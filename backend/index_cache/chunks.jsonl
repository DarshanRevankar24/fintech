However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. During the first quarter of 2026, the Company announced the following updated products: • 14-inch MacBook Pro® • iPad Pro® • Apple Vision Pro® Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, component pricing and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 13 Tariffs and Other Measures Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S., including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. On January 14, 2026, initial results were published of the previously announced U.S. Department of Commerce investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. The announcement of the initial results of the investigation did not impose any additional tariffs affecting the Company’s products at this time. Various modifications to U.S. tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional measures under the Section 232 semiconductor sector investigation, additional sector-based tariffs, or other measures.

Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2026 was higher compared to the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency loss regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2024 and the tax impact from foreign currency revaluations in the first quarter of 2025 related to the State Aid Decision. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2025 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations and other purchase obligations. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of December 27, 2025, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $44.4 billion, with $43.7 billion payable within 12 months. Other Purchase Obligations The Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, distribution rights, and the acquisition of capital assets related to product manufacturing. As of December 27, 2025, the Company had other purchase obligations of $35.1 billion, with $9.3 billion payable within 12 months. Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 27, 2025, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.26 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. During the first quarter of 2026, the Company repurchased $25.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Digital Markets Act Investigations On March 25, 2024, the European Commission (“Commission”) announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (“DMA”) (“Article 5(4) Investigation”). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (“Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Department of Justice Lawsuit On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted","metadata":{"chunk_id":"d7a8ef447435","file_name":"apple1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\apple1.txt","company":"AAPL","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":7040,"end_word_idx":7440}}

Department of Justice Lawsuit On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself. Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the “2021 Injunction”) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company’s in-app purchase system. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app (the “2025 Injunction”). The Company appealed the California District Court’s April 2025 decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit Court”). On December 11, 2025, the Ninth Circuit Court issued an order upholding the 2025 Injunction in part and modifying certain aspects to allow the Company to require parity in size, form and placement between the Company’s in-app purchase and any links for consumers to make purchases outside an app. The","metadata":{"chunk_id":"e83fe01a6898","file_name":"apple1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\apple1.txt","company":"AAPL","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":7360,"end_word_idx":7760}}

The deadline for the Company to file a petition for rehearing is March 2, 2026. Apple Inc. | Q1 2026 Form 10-Q | 19 Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2026 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2025 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2025 Form 10-K.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of March 29, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 17 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of March 29, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 49% and 19%.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariffs and other trade measures on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes","metadata":{"chunk_id":"06c3eef43b0c","file_name":"apple2.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\apple2.txt","company":"AAPL","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":4160,"end_word_idx":4560}}

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on corporate governance, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.

In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications and delays to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and","metadata":{"chunk_id":"c3ddd078bcd0","file_name":"apple2.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\apple2.txt","company":"AAPL","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":4800,"end_word_idx":5200}}

The Company plans to appeal the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Unless a stay is granted, any order by the Commission is effective while an appeal is pending. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission closed the Article 6(3) Investigation without imposing a fine and issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.

The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS® App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer’s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company’s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, including by appealing the California District Court’s most recent decision.

The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, including by appealing the California District Court’s most recent decision. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Apple Inc. | Q2 2025 Form 10-Q | 19 Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 28, 2024 (the “first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q”), in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except for the risk factors set forth below and those disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of the first quarter 2025 Form 10-Q, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2024 Form 10-K. The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.

Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them or affect the availability of such components and rare earths and other raw materials, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increasing the prices of its products and services. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s business and results of operations. Trade and other international disputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from such measures.

Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from such measures. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications and delays to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes are expected to be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control.

For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Apple Inc. | Q2 2025 Form 10-Q | 20 The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations","metadata":{"chunk_id":"f6060ea891e4","file_name":"apple2.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\apple2.txt","company":"AAPL","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":9600,"end_word_idx":10000}}

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues","metadata":{"chunk_id":"885bfbdfb924","file_name":"apple2.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\apple2.txt","company":"AAPL","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":9920,"end_word_idx":10320}}

The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or a change in or failure of one or more of the Company’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners. Varied stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. Various stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing expectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company’s business. The Company makes statements about its values, including the environmental and societal impact of its business, through various non-financial reports, information provided on the Company’s website, and in press statements and other communications. The Company also pursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control, and there can be no assurance that the Company will fully achieve all of its goals and initiatives. Efforts by the Company to advance its business and values, or achieve its goals and further its initiatives, or to align with stakeholders’ expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times conflicting federal, state and international laws, regulations and standards, or any failure or perceived failure to do so, can result in adverse reactions by consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 28, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 17 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 14%.

Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. During the third quarter of 2025, the Company announced iOS 26, macOS® Tahoe 26, iPadOS® 26, watchOS® 26, visionOS® 26 and tvOS® 26. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 13 Tariffs and Other Measures Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (“U.S. Tariffs”), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (“EU”), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors.

{"text":"232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company’s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company’s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company’s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 17 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2024 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations and the State Aid Decision tax payable. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June 28, 2025, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $44.1 billion, with $43.8 billion payable within 12 months. State Aid Decision Tax Payable During the first nine months of 2025, the Company released from escrow €14.2 billion, or $15.4 billion, to Ireland in connection with the State Aid Decision, which fully settled the obligation. Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has authorized share repurchase programs.

Apple Inc. | Q3 2025 Form 10-Q | 19 PART II — OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Digital Markets Act Investigations On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”) (the “Article 5(4) Investigation”). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third- party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (the “Article 6(4) Investigation”). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission’s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation.

Department of Justice Lawsuit On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself. Epic Games Epic Games, Inc.

The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court’s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit Court”). Although the Company’s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company’s appeal on an expedited basis, with arguments scheduled for October 2025. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Jonathan. This quarter, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $50 billion in revenue for the first time, up 26% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our platform and accelerating demand. We are in the beginning phases of AI diffusion and its broad GDP impact. Our TAM will grow substantially across every layer of the tech stack as this diffusion accelerates and spreads. In fact, even in these early innings, we have built an AI business that is larger than some of our biggest franchises that took decades to build. Today, I will focus my remarks across the three layers of our stack: Cloud & Token Factory, Agent Platform, and High Value Agentic Experiences. When it comes to our Cloud & Token Factory, the key to long term competitiveness is shaping our infrastructure to support new high-scale workloads. We are building this infrastructure out for the heterogenous and distributed nature of these workloads, ensuring the right fit with the geographic and segment-specific needs for all customers, including the long tail. The key metric we are optimizing for is tokens per watt per dollar, which comes down to increasing utilization and decreasing TCO using silicon, systems, and software. A good example of this is the 50% increase in throughput we were able to achieve in one of our highest volume workloads – OpenAI inferencing powering our Copilots. Another example was the unlocking of new capabilities and efficiencies for our Fairwater datacenters. In this instance, we connected both our Atlanta and Wisconsin sites through AI WAN to build a first-of-its-kind AI superfactory. Fairwater’s two-story design and liquid cooling allow us to run higher GPU densities and thereby improve both performance and latencies for high- scale training. All up, we added nearly one gigawatt of total capacity this quarter alone.

Fairwater’s two-story design and liquid cooling allow us to run higher GPU densities and thereby improve both performance and latencies for high- scale training. All up, we added nearly one gigawatt of total capacity this quarter alone. At the silicon layer, we have NVIDIA and AMD, and our own Maia chips, delivering the best all-up fleet performance, cost, and supply across multiple generations of hardware. Earlier this week, we brought online our Maia 200 accelerator. Maia 200 delivers 10+ petaFLOPS at FP4 precision with over 30% improved TCO, compared to the latest generation hardware in our fleet. We will be scaling this starting with inferencing and synthetic data gen for our superintelligence team, as well as doing inferencing for Copilot and Foundry. And given AI workloads are not just about AI accelerators, but also consume large amounts of compute, we are pleased with the progress we are making on the CPU side as well. Cobalt 200 is another big leap forward, delivering over 50% higher performance compared to our first custom-built processor for cloud-native workloads. Sovereignty is increasingly top of mind for customers, and we are expanding our solutions and global footprint to match. We announced DC investments in seven countries this quarter alone, supporting local data residency needs. And we offer the most comprehensive set of sovereignty solutions across public, private, and national partner clouds, so customers can choose the right approach for each workload, with the local control they require. Next, I want to talk about the agent platform. Like in every platform shift, all software is being rewritten. A new app platform is born. You can think of agents as the new Apps. And to build, deploy, and manage agents, customers will need a model catalog, tuning services, harnesses for orchestration, services for context engineering, AI safety, management, observability, and security. It starts with having broad model choice. Our customers expect to use multiple models as part of any workload that they can fine-tune and optimize based on cost, latency, and performance requirements. And we offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler. This quarter, we added support for GPT 5.2, as well as","metadata":{"chunk_id":"bb0f2dd9cdd3","file_name":"microsoft.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\microsoft.txt","company":"MSFT","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":640,"end_word_idx":1040}}

And we offer the broadest selection of models of any hyperscaler. This quarter, we added support for GPT 5.2, as well as Claude 4.5. Already, over 1,500 customers have used both Anthropic and OpenAI models on Foundry. We are seeing increasing demand for region-specific models, including Mistral and Cohere, as more customers look for sovereign AI choices. And we continue to invest in our first-party models, which are optimized to address the highest value customer scenarios, such as productivity, coding, and security. As part of Foundry, we also give customers the ability to customize and finetune models. Increasingly, customers want to be able to capture the tacit knowledge they possess inside of model weights as their core IP. This is probably the most important sovereign consideration for firms as AI diffuses more broadly across our GDP and every firm needs to protect their enterprise value. For agents to be effective, they need to be grounded in enterprise data and knowledge. That means connecting their agents to systems of record and operational data, analytical data, as well as semi-structured and unstructured productivity and communications data. And this is what we are doing with our unified IQ layer, spanning Fabric, Foundry, and the data powering Microsoft 365. In a world of context engineering, Foundry Knowledge and Fabric are gaining momentum. Foundry Knowledge delivers better context with automated source routing and advanced agentic retrieval, while respecting user permissions. And Fabric brings together end-to-end operational, real-time, and analytical data. Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric’s annual revenue run rate is now over two billion dollars, with over 31,000 customers. And it continues to be the fastest growing analytics platform on the market, with revenue up 60% year-over-year. All-up, the number of customers spending one million dollars-plus per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80%, driven by strong growth in every industry.

All-up, the number of customers spending one million dollars-plus per quarter on Foundry grew nearly 80%, driven by strong growth in every industry. And over 250 customers are on track to process over one trillion tokens on Foundry this year. There are many great examples of customers using all of this capability on Foundry to build their own agentic systems. Alaska Airlines is creating natural language flight search. BMW is speeding up design cycles. Land O’Lakes is enabling precision farming for co-op members. And Symphony.AI is addressing bottle necks in the CPG industry. And of course Foundry remains a powerful on-ramp for our entire cloud. The vast majority of Foundry customers use additional Azure solutions like developer services, app services, databases, as they scale. Beyond Fabric and Foundry, we are also addressing agent building by knowledge workers with Copilot Studio and Agent Builder. Over 80% of the Fortune 500 have active agents built using these low- code/no-code tools. As agents proliferate, every customer will need new ways to deploy, manage, and protect them. We believe this creates a major new category and significant growth opportunity for us. This quarter, we introduced Agent 365, which makes it easy for organizations to extend their existing governance, identity, security, and management to agents. That means the same controls they already use across Microsoft 365 and Azure now extend to agents they build and deploy on our cloud or any other cloud. And partners like Adobe, Databricks, Genspark, Glean, NVIDIA, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday are already integrating Agent 365. We are the first provider to offer this type of agent “control plane” across clouds. Now, let us turn to the high value agentic experiences we are building. AI experiences are intent-driven and are beginning to work at task-scope. We are entering an age of “macro delegation and micro steering” across domains. Intelligence using multiple models is built into multiple form factors. You see this in chat, in new agent inbox apps, “coworker” scaffoldings, agent workflows embedded in applications and IDEs that are used every day, or even in in your command line with file system access and skills.

In consumer, for example, Copilot experiences span chat, news feed, search, creation, browsing, shopping, and integrations into the operating system. And it is gaining momentum. Daily users of our Copilot app increased nearly 3X year-over-year. And with Copilot Checkout, we have partnered with PayPal, Shopify, and Stripe so customers can make purchases directly within the app. With Microsoft 365 Copilot, we are focused on organization-wide productivity. Work IQ takes the data underneath Microsoft 365 and creates the most valuable stateful agent for every organization. It delivers powerful reasoning capabilities over people, their roles, their artifacts, their communications, and their history and memory – all within an organization’s security boundary. Microsoft 365 Copilot’s accuracy and latency powered by Work IQ is unmatched, delivering faster and more accurate work-grounded results than competition. And we have seen our biggest quarter-over-quarter improvement in response quality to date. This has driven record usage intensity, with the average number of conversations per user doubling year-over-year. Microsoft 365 Copilot also is becoming a true daily habit, with daily active users increasing 10X year-over-year. We are also seeing strong momentum with Researcher agent which supports both OpenAI and Claude, as well as Agent Mode in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. All up, it was a record quarter for Microsoft 365 Copilot seat adds, up over 160% year-over-year. We saw accelerating seat growth quarter-over-quarter and now have 15 million paid Microsoft 365 Copilot seats, and multiples more enterprise Chat users. And we are seeing larger commercial deployments. The number of customers with over 35,000 seats tripled year-over-year. Fiserv, ING, NASA, University of Kentucky, University of Manchester, US Department of Interior, and Westpac, all purchased over 35,000 seats. Publicis alone purchased over 95,000 seats for nearly all its employees. We are also taking share in Dynamics 365 with built-in agents across the entire suite. A great example of this is how Visa is turning customer conversation data into knowledge articles with our Customer Knowledge Management Agent in Dynamics.","metadata":{"chunk_id":"a130de7fce9d","file_name":"microsoft.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\microsoft.txt","company":"MSFT","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":1600,"end_word_idx":2000}}

A great example of this is how Visa is turning customer conversation data into knowledge articles with our Customer Knowledge Management Agent in Dynamics. And how Sandvik is using our Sales Qualification Agent to automate lead qualification across tens of thousands of potential customers. In coding, we are seeing strong growth across all paid GitHub Copilot. Copilot Pro+ subs for individual devs increased 77% quarter-over-quarter. And, all up now we have over 4.7 million paid Copilot subscribers, up 75% year-over-year. Siemens, for example is going all in on GitHub, adopting the full platform to increase developer productivity, after a successful Copilot rollout to 30,000 of its developers. GitHub Agent HQ is the organizing layer for all coding agents, like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI, in the context of customers’ GitHub repos. With Copilot CLI and VS Code, we offer developers the full spectrum of form factors and models they need for AI-first coding workflows. And when you add Work IQ as a skill or an MCP to our developer workflow, it is a game changer, surfacing work context like emails, meetings, docs, projects, messages, and more. You can simply ask the agent to plan and execute changes to your code based on an update to a spec in SharePoint, or using the transcript of your last engineering and design meeting in Teams! And we are going beyond that with the GitHub Copilot SDK. Developers can now embed the same runtime behind Copilot CLI—multi- model, multi-step planning, tools, MCP integration, auth, streaming— directly into their applications. In security, we added a dozen new and updated Security Copilot agents across Defender, Entra, Intune, and Purview. For example, Icertis’ SOC team used Security Copilot agents to reduce manual triage time by 75%, which is a real game-changer in an industry facing a severe talent shortage. To make it easier for security teams to onboard, we are rolling out Security Copilot to all E5 customers.

And our security solutions are also becoming essential to manage organizations’ AI deployments. 24 billion Copilot interactions were audited by Purview this quarter, up 9X year-over-year. Finally, I want to talk about two additional high impact agentic experiences. First, in healthcare, Dragon Copilot is the leader in its category, helping over one hundred thousand medical providers automate their workflows. Mount Sinai Health is now moving to a system-wide Dragon Copilot deployment for providers after a successful trial with its primary care physicians. All up, we helped document 21 million patient encounters this quarter, up 3X year-over-year. And, second, when it comes to science and engineering, companies like Unilever in consumer goods and Synopsys in EDA are using Microsoft Discovery to orchestrate specialized agents for R&D end to end. They are able to reason over scientific literature and internal knowledge, formulate hypotheses, spin up simulations, and continuously iterate to drive new discoveries. Beyond AI, we continue to invest in all of our core franchises and meet the needs of our customers and partners, and we are seeing strong progress ... For example, when it comes to cloud migrations, our new SQL Server has over 2X the IaaS adoption of the previous version. In security, we now have 1.6 million security customers – including over a million who use four or more of our workloads. Windows reached a big milestone: One billion Windows 11 users, up over 45% year-over-year. And we had share gains this quarter across Windows, Edge, and Bing. Double-digit member growth in LinkedIn, with 30% growth in paid video ads. And in gaming we are committed to delivering great games across Xbox, PC, cloud, and every other device. And we saw record PC players, and paid streaming hours on Xbox. In closing, we feel very good about how we are delivering for customers today, and building the full stack to capture the opportunity ahead.

With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook. I look forward to rejoining for your questions. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. With growing demand for our offerings and focused execution by our sales teams, we again exceeded expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings per share, while investing to fuel long-term growth. This quarter, revenue was $81.3 billion, up 17% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 16% and 14% in constant currency while operating income increased 21% and 19% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $4.14, an increase of 24 and 21% in constant currency, when adjusted for the impact from our investment in OpenAI. And FX increased reported results slightly less than expected, particularly in Intelligent Cloud revenue. Company gross margin percentage was 68%, down slightly year-over-year primarily driven by continued investments in AI infrastructure and growing AI product usage that was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud, as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency driven by R&D investments in compute capacity and AI talent, as well as impairment charges in our gaming business. Operating margins increased year-over- year to 47%, ahead of expectations. As a reminder, we still account for our investment in OpenAI under the equity method. And as a result of OpenAI’s recapitalization, we now record gains or losses based on our share of the change in their net assets on their balance sheet as opposed to our share of their operating profit or losses from their income statement. Therefore, we recorded a gain which drove other income and expense to $10 billion in our GAAP results. When adjusted for the OpenAI impact, other income and expense was slightly negative, and lower than expected, driven by net losses on investments. Capital expenditures were $37.5 billion, and this quarter, roughly two thirds of our capex was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs.

When adjusted for the OpenAI impact, other income and expense was slightly negative, and lower than expected, driven by net losses on investments. Capital expenditures were $37.5 billion, and this quarter, roughly two thirds of our capex was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs. Our customer demand continues to exceed our supply. Therefore, we must balance the need to have our incoming supply better meet growing Azure demand with expanding first-party AI usage across services like M365 Copilot and Github Copilot, increasing allocations to R&D teams to accelerate product innovation, and continued replacement of end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond. This quarter, total finance leases were $6.7 billion and were primarily for large datacenter sites. And cash paid for P, P, and E was $29.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $35.8 billion, up 60% driven by strong cloud billings and collections. And free cash flow was $5.9 billion and decreased sequentially reflecting the higher cash capital expenditures from a lower mix of finance leases. And finally, we returned $12.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 32% year-over-year. Now, to our commercial results. Commercial bookings increased 230% and 228% in constant currency driven by the previously announced large Azure commitment from OpenAI that reflects multi-year demand needs, as well as the previously announced Anthropic commitment from November, and healthy growth across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation, which continues to be reported net of reserves, increased to $625 billion and was up 110% year- over-year with a weighted average duration of approximately two and a half years. Roughly 25% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 39% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 156%. Approximately 45% of our commercial RPO balance is from OpenAI. The significant remaining balance grew 28% and reflects ongoing broad customer demand across the portfolio.

Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 67%, and down year-over-year due to continued investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $34.1 billion and grew 16% and 14% in constant currency. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency with consistent execution in the core business and increasing contribution from strong Copilot results. ARPU growth was again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. And paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over- year to over 450 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 13% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 29% and 27% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 6%. LinkedIn revenue increased 11% and 10% in constant currency driven by Marketing Solutions. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 17% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17% and 15% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage increased, again driven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial cloud that were partially offset by continued investments in AI, including the impact of growing Copilot usage. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency and operating income increased 22% and 19% in constant currency. Operating margins increased year-over- year to 60% driven by improved operating leverage as well as the higher gross margins noted earlier. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $32.9 billion and grew 29% and 28% in constant currency. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39% and 38% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, with ongoing efficiency gains across our fungible fleet enabling us to reallocate some capacity to Azure that was monetized in the quarter.

As mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong demand across workloads, customer segments, and geographic regions and demand continues to exceed available supply. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 1% in constant currency ahead of expectations driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, including a benefit from the launch of SQL server 2025, as well as higher transactional purchasing ahead of memory price increases. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year driven by continued investments in AI and sales mix shift to Azure partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 3% and 2% in constant currency and operating income grew 28% and 27% in constant currency. Operating margins were 42%, down slightly year-over-year, as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.3 billion and declined 3%. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Windows OEM grew 5% with strong execution as well as a continued benefit from Windows 10 end of support. Results were ahead of expectations as inventory levels remained elevated with increased purchasing ahead of memory price increases. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly below expectations driven by some execution challenges. As expected, the sequential growth rate moderated as the benefit from third-party partnerships normalized. And in Gaming, revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency and was below expectations driven by first-party content with impact across the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 2% and 1% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage increased year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses.

Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 3 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 4 points in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points. As a reminder, this impact is due to the exchange rates a year ago. Starting with the total company. We expect revenue of $80.65 to $81.75 billion or growth of 15% to %17 with continued strong growth across our commercial businesses, partially offset by our consumer businesses. We expect COGS of $26.65 to $26.85 billion, or growth of 22% to 23%. And operating expense of $17.8 to $17.9 billion or growth of 10% to 11% driven by continued investment in R&D AI compute capacity and talent against a low prior year comparable. Operating margins should be down slightly year-over-year. Excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense is expected to be roughly $700 million driven by a fair market gain in our equity portfolio and interest income, partially offset by interest expense, which includes the interest payments related to datacenter finance leases. And we expect our adjusted Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Next, we expect capital expenditures to decrease on a sequential basis due to the normal variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. As we work to close the gap between demand and supply, we expect the mix of short-lived assets to remain similar to Q2. Now, our commercial business.

In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a growing expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. As a reminder, the significant OpenAI contract signed in Q2 represents multi-year demand needs from them, which will result in some quarterly volatility in both bookings and RPO growth rates going forward. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 65%, down year-over-year driven by continued investments in AI. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $34.25 to $34.55 billion, or growth of 14% to 15%. In M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with continued stability in year-over-year growth rates on a large and expanding base. Accelerating Copilot momentum and ongoing E5 adoption will again drive ARPU growth. M365 commercial products revenue should decline in the low-single digits, down sequentially assuming Office 2024 transactional purchasing trends normalize. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes components that can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high-twenty percent range driven by growth in ARPU as well as continued subscription volume. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low-double digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $34.1 to $34.4 billion, or growth of 27% to 29%. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 37% and 38% in constant currency against a prior year comparable that included significantly accelerating growth rates in both Q3 and Q4.

As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low-single digits as growth rates normalize following the launch of SQL Server 2025, though increased memory pricing could create additional volatility in transactional purchasing. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.3 to $12.8 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the low teens. Growth rates will be impacted as the benefit from Windows 10 end of support normalizes and as elevated inventory levels come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline roughly 10 percent. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal, in part due to the potential impact on the PC market from increased memory pricing. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high single digits. Even as we work to improve execution, we expect continued share gains across Bing and Edge, with growth driven by volume. And we expect sequential growth moderation as the contribution from third-party partnerships continues to normalize. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from strong content performance, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass. And hardware revenue should decline year-over-year. Now some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase Q4 total revenue and COGS growth by less than 1 point with no impact to operating expense growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 1 point in Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing, and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud.

Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly 1 point in Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing, and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud. With the strong work delivered in H1 to prioritize investment in key growth areas and the favorable impact from a higher mix of revenue in our Windows OEM and Commercial on-prem businesses, we now expect FY26 operating margins to be up slightly. We mentioned the potential impact on Windows OEM and on premises server markets from increased memory pricing earlier. In addition, rising memory prices would impact capital expenditures, though the impact on Microsoft Cloud gross margins will build more gradually as these assets depreciate over six years. In closing, we delivered strong top-line growth in H1 and are investing across every layer of the stack to continue to deliver high value solutions and tools to our customers. With that, let’s go to Q&A, Jonathan. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I’m looking at a Microsoft print where earnings is growing 24% year on year, which is a spectacular result. Great execution on your part, top line growing well, margins expanding, but I’m looking at after-hours trading, and the stock is still down. And I think one of the core issues that is weighing on investors is CapEx is growing faster than we expected, and maybe Azure is growing a little bit slower than we expected. And I think that fundamentally comes down to a concern on the ROI on this CapEx spend over time. I was hoping you guys could help us fill in some of the blanks a little bit in terms of how should we think about capacity expansion and what that can yield in terms of Azure growth, going forward. But more to the point, how should we think about the ROI on this investment as it comes to fruition? Thanks, guys.

But more to the point, how should we think about the ROI on this investment as it comes to fruition? Thanks, guys. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith, and let me start and Satya can add some broader comments, I’m sure. I think the first thing I think you really asked a very direct correlation that I do think many investors are doing, which is between the CapEx spend and seeing an Azure revenue number. And we tried last quarter, and I think again this quarter, to talk more specifically about all the places that the CapEx spend, especially the short-lived CapEx spend across CPU and GPU, and where that will show up. Sometimes, I think it’s probably better to think about the Azure guidance that we give as an allocated capacity guide about what we can deliver in Azure revenue, because as we spend the capital and put GPUs, specifically, it applies to CPUs, but GPUs more specifically, we’re really making long- term decisions. And the first thing we’re doing is solving for the increased usage in sales and the accelerating pace of M365 Copilot, as well as GitHub Copilot, our first-party apps. Then we make sure we’re investing in the long-term nature of R&D and product innovation. And much of the acceleration that I think you’ve seen from us in products over the past bit is coming because we are allocating GPUs and capacity to many of the talented AI people we’ve been hiring over the past years. Then when you end up, is that you end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand. And a way to think about it, because I think I get asked this question sometimes, is if I had taken the GPUs that just came online in Q1 and Q2, in terms of GPUs, and allocated them all to Azure, the KPI would have been over 40. And I think the most important thing to realize is that this is about investing in all the layers of the stack that benefit customers. And I think that’s hopefully,","metadata":{"chunk_id":"aa90d622052c","file_name":"microsoft.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\microsoft.txt","company":"MSFT","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":5120,"end_word_idx":5520}}

And I think that’s hopefully, helpful in terms of thinking about capital growth. It shows in every piece. It shows in revenue growth across the business and shows as OpEx growth as we invest in our people. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I think you, Amy, covered it, but basically, as an investor, I think when you think about our capital and you think about the GM profile of our portfolio, you should obviously, think about Azure, but you should think about M365 Copilot. And you should think about GitHub Copilot. You should think about Dragon Copilot, Security copilot. All of those have a GM profile and a lifetime value. I mean, if you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us. And so, we don’t want to maximize just one business of ours. We want to be able to allocate capacity while we’re supply constrained in a way that allows us to essentially build the best LTV portfolio. That’s on one side. And the other one that Amy mentioned is also R&D. I mean, you’ve got to think about compute is also R&D. And that’s the second element of it. And so, we’re using all of that obviously, to optimize for the long term. KEITH WEISS: Excellent. Thank you. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. One of the other questions we believe investors want to understand is how to think about your line of sight from hardware CapEx investment to revenue and margins.

One of the other questions we believe investors want to understand is how to think about your line of sight from hardware CapEx investment to revenue and margins. You capitalized servers over six years, but the average duration of your RPO is 2.5 years, up from two years last quarter. How do investors get comfortable that since a lot of this CapEx is AI centric, that you’ll be able to capture sufficient revenue over the six-year useful, while the hardware delivers solid revenue and gross profit dollars growth, hopefully one similar to the CPU revenue? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Mark. Let me start with at a high level and Satya can add as well. I think you know, when you think about average duration, I think what you’re getting to and we need to remember is that average duration is a combination of a broad set of contract arrangements that we have. A lot of them around things like M365 or a Biz App portfolio are shorter dated, three-year contracts. And so, they have, quite frankly, a short duration. The majority, then, that’s remaining are Azure contracts that are longer duration. And you saw that this quarter when we saw the extension of that duration from around two years to 2.5. And the way to think about that is the majority of the capital that we’re spending today, and a lot of the GPUs that we’re buying are already contracted for most of their useful life. And so, a way to think about that is much of that risk that I think you’re pointing to isn’t there, because they’re already sold for the entirety of their useful life. And so, part of it exists because you have this shorter-dated RPO because of some of the M365 stuff. If you look at the Azure-only RPO, it’s a little bit more extended. A lot of that is CPU basis. It’s not just GPU. And on the GPU contracts that we’ve talked about, including for some of our largest customers, those are sold for the entire useful life of the GPU. And so, there’s not the risk to which I think you may be referring. Hopefully, that’s helpful.

And so, there’s not the risk to which I think you may be referring. Hopefully, that’s helpful. SATYA NADELLA: And just one other thing I would add to it is, in addition to what Amy mentioned, which is it’s already contracted for the useful life, is we do use software to continuously run even the latest models on the fleet that is aging, if you will. That’s what gives us that duration. And so, at the end of the day, that’s why we even think about aging the fleet constantly. It’s not about buying a whole lot of gear one year. It’s about each year you write the Moore’s Law, you add, you use software, and then you optimize across all of it. AMY HOOD: And Mark, maybe to state this, in case it’s not obvious, is that as you go through the useful life, actually you get more and more and more efficient at its delivery. Where you’ve sold the entirety of its life, the margins actually improve with time. And so, I think that may be a good reminder to people, as we see that, obviously in the CPU fleet all the time. MARK MOERDLER: That’s a great answer. I really appreciate it and thank you. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) The next question comes from the line of Brant Thill with Jefferies. Please. Please proceed. BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Amy, on 45% of the backlog being related to OpenAI, I’m just curious if you can comment. There’s obviously concern about the durability. And I know maybe there’s not much you can say on this, but I think everyone’s concerned about the exposure, and if you could maybe talk through your perspective and what both you and Satya are seeing. AMY HOOD: I think maybe I would have thought about the question quite differently, Brent. The first thing to focus on is the reason we talked about that number is because 55%, or roughly $350 billion, is related to the breadth of our portfolio, a breadth of customers across solutions, across Azure, across industries, across geographies.","metadata":{"chunk_id":"934eb27d8ace","file_name":"microsoft.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\microsoft.txt","company":"MSFT","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":6080,"end_word_idx":6480}}

The first thing to focus on is the reason we talked about that number is because 55%, or roughly $350 billion, is related to the breadth of our portfolio, a breadth of customers across solutions, across Azure, across industries, across geographies. That is a significant RPO balance, larger than most peers, more diversified than most peers. And frankly, I think we have super high confidence in it. And when you think about that portion alone growing 28%, it’s really impressive work on the breadth as well as the adoption curve that we’re seeing, which is, I think what I get asked most frequently. It’s grown by customer segment, by industry and by geo. And so, it’s very consistent. And so, then if you’re asking about how do I feel about OpenAI and the contract and the health, listen, it’s a great partnership. We continue to be their provider of scale. We’re excited to do that. We sit under one of the most successful businesses built, and we continue to feel quite good about that. It’s allowed us to remain a leader in terms of what we’re building and being on the cutting edge of app innovation. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, thank you very much. Satya and Amy, regardless of how you allocate the capacity between first party and third party, can you comment qualitatively on the amount of capacity that you have coming on? I think the one gigawatt added in the December quarter was extraordinary and hints that the capacity adds are accelerating, but I think a lot of investors have their eyes on Fairwater Atlanta, Fairwater Wisconsin and would love some comments about the magnitude of the capacity adds, regardless of how they’re allocated in the coming quarters. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Yeah, Karl, I think we’ve said a couple of things. We’re working as hard as we can to add capacity as quickly as we can. You’ve mentioned specific sites like Atlanta or Wisconsin. Those are multiyear deliveries, so I wouldn’t focus necessarily on specific locations.

Those are multiyear deliveries, so I wouldn’t focus necessarily on specific locations. The real thing we’ve got to do, and we’re working incredibly hard at doing it, is adding capacity globally. A lot of that will be added in the United States, the two locations you’ve mentioned, but it also needs to be added across the globe to meet the customer demand that we’re seeing and the increased usage. We’ll continue to add both long-lived infrastructure. The way to think about that is we need to make sure we’ve got power and land and facilities available, and we’ll continue to put GPUs and CPUs in them when they’re done as quickly as we can. And then finally, we’ll try to make sure we can get as efficient as we possibly can on the pace at which we do that and how we operate them, so that they can have the highest possible utility. And so, I think it’s not really about two places, Karl. I would definitely abstract away from that. Those are multiyear delivery timelines, but really, we just need to get it done every location where we’re currently in a build. We’re starting to do that. We’re working as quickly as we can. KARL KEIRSTEAD: Okay, got it. Thank you. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MURPHY, J.P. Morgan: Thank you so much. Satya, the performance achievements of the Maia 200 accelerator, for instance, looked quite remarkable, especially in comparison to TPUs and Trainium and Blackwell, which have just been around a lot longer. Can you put that accomplishment in perspective in terms of how much of a core competency you think silicon might become for Microsoft? And Amy, are there any ramifications worth mentioning there in terms of supporting your gross margin profile for inference costs, going forward? SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, no, thanks for the question. A couple of things. One is we’ve been at this in a variety of different forms for a long, long time in terms of building our own silicon.

A couple of things. One is we’ve been at this in a variety of different forms for a long, long time in terms of building our own silicon. And so, we’re very, very thrilled about the progress with Maia 200. And especially when we think about running a GPT-5.2 and the performance we’re able to get in the gems at SP4 just proves the point that when you have a new workload, a new shape of a workload, you can start innovating end to end between the model and the silicon and the entire system. It’s just not even about just the silicon. The way the networking works at rack scale that’s optimized with memory for this particular workload. And the other thing is we’re obviously roundtripping and working very closely with our own superintelligence team, with all of our models. As you can imagine, whatever we build will be all optimized for Maia. We feel great about it. And I think the way to think about, all up, is we’re in such early innings. I mean, even just look at the amount of silicon innovation and systems innovation. Even since December, I think the new thing is everybody is talking about low latency inference. And so, one of the things we want to make sure is we’re not locked into any one thing. If anything, we have great partnership with Nvidia, with AMD. They’re innovating; we’re innovating. We want a fleet at any given point in time to have access to the best TCO. And it’s not a one-generation game. I think a lot of folks just talk about who’s ahead. Just remember, you have to be ahead for all time to come. And that means you really want to think about having a lot of innovation that happens out there to be in your fleet so that your fleet is fundamentally advantaged at the TCO level. That’s how I look at it, which is we are excited about Maia. We’re excited about Cobalt. We’re excited about our DPU, our NICs. We have a lot of systems capability.

That means we can vertically integrate. And because we can vertically integrate doesn’t mean we just only vertically integrate. And so, we want to be able to have the flexibility here, and that’s what you see us do. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Great, thank you very much. Satya, we heard a lot about frontier transformations from Judson at Ignite, and we’ve seen customers realize breakthrough benefits when they adopt the Microsoft AI stack. Can you help frame for us the momentum in enterprises embarking on these journeys and any expectation for how much their spend with Microsoft can expand in becoming frontier firms? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, thank you for that. I think one of the things that we are seeing is the adoption across the three major suites of ours. If you take M365, you take what’s happening with Security and you take GitHub, in fact, it’s fascinating. I mean, these three things had, effectively compounding effects for our customers in the past. Something like Entra as an identity system or Defender as the protection system across all three was super helpful. But so, what now you’re seeing is something like WorkIQ, I mean, just to give you a flavor for it, the most important database underneath for any company that uses Microsoft today is the data underneath Microsoft 365. And the reason is because it has all this tacit information. Who are your people? What are the relationships? What are the projects they’re working on? What are their artifacts, their communications? That’s a super important asset for any business process, business workflow context. In fact, the scenario I even had in my transcript around you can now take WorkIQ as an MCP server and in a GitHub repo and say, hey, please look at my design meetings for the last month in Teams and tell me if my repo","metadata":{"chunk_id":"79db8a77795c","file_name":"microsoft.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\microsoft.txt","company":"MSFT","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":7360,"end_word_idx":7760}}

In fact, the scenario I even had in my transcript around you can now take WorkIQ as an MCP server and in a GitHub repo and say, hey, please look at my design meetings for the last month in Teams and tell me if my repo reflects it. I mean, that’s a pretty high level way to think about how what is happening previously, perhaps with our tools business and our GitHub business are suddenly now being transformative. That agent black plane is really transforming companies in some sense. That’s, I think, the most magical thing, which is you deploy these things and suddenly the agents are helping you coordinate, bring more leverage to your enterprise. Then on top of it, of course, there is the transformation, which is what businesses are doing. How should we think about customer service? How should we think about marketing? How should we think about finance? How should we think about that and build our own agents? That’s where all the services in Fabric and Foundry are. And of course the GitHub tooling is helping them, or even the low-code, no-code tools. I had some stats on how much that’s being used. But one of the more exciting things for me is these new agent systems, M365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Security Copilot all coming together to compound the benefits of all the data and all the deployment, I think is probably the most transformative effect right now. BRAD ZELNICK: Thank you, very helpful. JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thanks for squeezing me in. The last few quarters we talked, besides the GPU side, we talked about CPU as well on the Azure side. And you had some operational changes at the beginning of January last year. Can you speak what you saw there and maybe put it more in a bigger picture in terms of clients realizing that their move to the cloud is important, if you want to deliver proper AI? What are we seeing in terms of cloud transitions? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: I didn’t quite – JONATHAN NEILSON: Sorry, Raimo, you’re asking about the SMC","metadata":{"chunk_id":"33724573b823","file_name":"microsoft.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\microsoft.txt","company":"MSFT","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":7680,"end_word_idx":8080}}

What are we seeing in terms of cloud transitions? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: I didn’t quite – JONATHAN NEILSON: Sorry, Raimo, you’re asking about the SMC CPU side, or can you just repeat the question, please? RAIMO LENSCHOW: Yeah, yeah, sorry. I was wondering about the CPU side of Azure, because we had some operational changes there. And we also hear from the field a lot that people are realizing they need to be in the cloud if they want to do proper AI, and if that’s kind of driving momentum. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I think I get it. First of all, I had mentioned in my remarks that when you think about AI workloads, you shouldn’t think of AI workloads as just AI accelerator compute, because in some sense, take any agent. The agent will then spawn through tools used, maybe a container, which runs obviously, on compute. In fact, whenever we think about even building out of the fleet, we think of in ratios, even for a training job, by the way. An AI training job requires a bunch of compute and a bunch of storage very close to compute. And so, therefore, same thing in inferencing as well. In inferencing with Agent Mode would require you to essentially, provision a computer or computing resources to the agent. They don’t need GPUs. They’re running on GPUs, but they need computers, which are compute and storage. That’s what’s happening even in the new workload. The other thing you mentioned is the cloud migrations are still going on. In fact, one of the stats I had was SQL, our latest SQL Server growing as an IaaS service in Azure. And so, that’s one of the reasons why we have to think about our Commercial Cloud and keep it balanced with the rest of our AI cloud, because when clients bring their workloads and build new workloads, they need all of these infrastructure elements in the region in which they’re deploying.

Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. Thank you, Toshiya. We delivered another strong quarter with revenue of $44 billion, up 69% year-over-year, exceeding our outlook in what proved to be a challenging operating environment. Data Center revenue of $39 billion grew 73% year-on-year. AR workloads have transitioned strongly to inference, and AI factory build outs are driving significant revenue. Our customers' commitments are firm. On April 9, the US government issued new export controls on H20. Our data center GPU designed specifically for the China market. We sold H20 with the approval of the previous administration. Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory. In Q1, we recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue, which occurred prior to April 9, but also recognized a $4.5 billion charge, as we wrote down inventory and purchase obligations tied to orders we had received prior to April 9. We were unable to ship $2.5 billion in H20 revenue in the first quarter due to the new export controls. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated, as we were able to reuse certain materials. We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the US government's revised export control rules.

Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide. Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in Data Center revenue. Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of Data Center compute revenue in the quarter, with a transition from Hopper nearly complete. The introduction of GB200 NVL was a fundamental architectural change to enable Data Center scale workloads and to achieve the lowest cost per inference token. While these systems are complex to build, we have seen a significant improvement in manufacturing yields and rack shipments are moving to strong rates to end customers. GB200 NVL racks are now generally available for model builders, enterprises and sovereign customers to develop and deploy AI. On average, major hyperscalers are each deploying nearly 1,000 NVL72 racks or 72,000 Blackwell GPUs per week and are on track to further ramp output this quarter. Microsoft, for example, has already deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and is expected to ramp to hundreds of thousands of GB200s with OpenAI as one of its key customers. Key learnings from the GB200 ramp will allow for a smooth transition to the next phase of our product roadmap, Blackwell Ultra. Sampling of GB300 systems began earlier this month at the major CSPs, and we expect production shipments to commerce later this quarter.

Microsoft processed over 100 trillion tokens in Q1, a five-fold increase on a year-over-year basis. This exponential growth in Azure OpenAI is representative of strong demand for Azure AI Foundry as well as other AI services across Microsoft's platform. Inference serving startups are now serving models using B200, tripling their token generation rate and corresponding revenues for high value reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 as reported by artificial analysis. NVIDIA Dynamo on Blackwell NVL72 turbocharges AI inference throughput by 30x for the new reasoning models sweeping the industry. Developer engagements increased with adoption ranging from LLM providers such as Perplexity to financial services institutions such as Capital One, who reduced agentic chatbot latency by 5x with Dynamo. In the latest MLPerf inference results, we submitted our first results using GB200 NVL72, delivering up to 30x higher inference throughput compared to our eight GPU H200 submission on the challenging Llama 3.1 benchmark. This feat was achieved through a combination of tripling the performance for GPU as well as 9x more GPUs, all connected on a single NVLink domain. And while Blackwell is still early in its lifecycle, software optimizations have already improved its performance by 1.5x in the last month alone. We expect to continue improving the performance of Blackwell through its operational life as we have done with Hopper and Ampere. For example, we increased the inference performance of Hopper by four times over two years. This is the benefit of NVIDIA's programmable CUDA architecture and rich ecosystem. The pace and scale of AI factory deployments are accelerating with nearly 100 NVIDIA-powered AI factories in flight this quarter, a two-fold increase year-over-year, with the average number of GPUs powering","metadata":{"chunk_id":"7da953b66564","file_name":"nvidia1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia1.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":960,"end_word_idx":1360}}

The pace and scale of AI factory deployments are accelerating with nearly 100 NVIDIA-powered AI factories in flight this quarter, a two-fold increase year-over-year, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. And more AI factory projects are starting across industries and geographies. NVIDIA's full stack architecture is underpinning AI factory deployments as industry leaders like AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek, and Telenor are strategically vital sovereign clouds like those recently announced in Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UAE. We have a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of NVIDIA AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future. The transition from generative to agentic AI, AI capable of perceiving, reasoning, planning and acting will transform every industry, every company and country. We envision AI agents as a new digital workforce capable of handling tasks ranging from customer service to complex decision-making processes. We introduced the Llama Nemotron family of open reasoning models designed to supercharge agentic AI platforms for enterprises. Built on the Llama architecture, these models are available as NIMs or NVIDIA inference microservices with multiple sizes to meet diverse deployment needs. Our post training enhancements have yielded a 20% accuracy boost and a 5x increase in inference speed, leading platform companies including Accenture, Cadence, Deloitte and Microsoft are transforming work with our reasoning models. NVIDIA NeMo microservices are generally available across industries are being leveraged by leading enterprises to build, optimize and scale AI applications.

For AI-powered cybersecurity leading companies like Check Point, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA's AI security and software stack to build, optimize and secure agentic workflows, with CrowdStrike realizing 2x faster detection triage with 50% less compute cost. Moving to networking. Sequential growth in networking resumed in Q1 with revenue up 64% quarter-over-quarter to $5 billion. Our customers continue to leverage our platform to efficiently scale up and scale out AI factory workloads. We created the world's fastest switch, NVLink for scale up, our NVLink compute fabric in its fifth generation offers 14x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5. NVLink 72 carries 130 terabytes per second of bandwidth in a single rack, equivalent to the entirety of the world's peak internet traffic. NVLink is a new growth vector and is off to a great start with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. At COMPUTEX, we announced NVLink Fusion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the NVIDIA platform with NVLink. We are now enabling key partners, including ASIC providers such as MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies and Astera Labs, as well as CPU suppliers such as Fujitsu and Qualcomm to leverage and relink Fusion to connect our respective ecosystems. For scale out, our enhanced Ethernet offerings delivered the highest throughput, lowest latency networking for AI. Spectrum-X posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth and is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue. Adoption is widespread across major CSPs and consumer internet companies, including CoreWeave, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud and xAI.

Transitioning to a quick summary of our revenue by geography. China as a percentage of our Data Center revenue was slightly below our expectations and down sequentially due to H20 export licensing controls. For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China Data Center revenue. As a reminder, while Singapore represented nearly 20% of our Q1 billed revenue as many of our large customers use Singapore for centralized invoicing, our products are almost always shipped elsewhere. Note that over 99% of H100, H200, and Blackwell Data Center compute revenue billed to Singapore was for orders from US-based customers. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue was a record $3.8 billion, increasing 48% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. Strong adoption by gamers, creatives and AI enthusiasts have made Blackwell our fastest ramp ever, against a backdrop of robust demand, we greatly improved our supply and availability in Q1 and expect to continue these efforts in Q2. AI is transforming PC and creator and gamers. With a 100 million user installed base GeForce represents the largest footprint for PC developers. This quarter, we added to our AI PC laptop offerings, including models 5 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Nintendo has shipped over 150 million switch consoles to-date, making it one of the most successful gaming systems in history. Moving to Pro Visualization, revenue of $509 million was flat sequentially and up 19% year-on-year. Tariff related uncertainty temporarily impacted Q1 systems and demand for our AI workstations is strong, and we expect sequential revenue growth to resume in Q2. NVIDIA DGX Spark and DGX Station revolutionize personal computing by putting the power of an AI supercomputer in a desktop form factor. DGX Spark delivers up to 1 petaflop of AI compute while DGX Station offers an incredible 20 petaflops and is powered by the GB300 Superchip. DGX Spark will be available in calendar Q3 and DGX Station later this year. We have deepened Omniverse's integration and adoption into some of the world's leading software platforms including Databricks, SAP and Schneider Electric. New Omniverse blueprints such as Mega for at-scale robotic fleet management are being leveraged in KION Group, Pegatron, Accenture and other leading companies to enhance industrial operations. At COMPUTEX, we showcased Omniverse's great traction with technology manufacturing leaders, including TSMC, Quanta, Foxconn, Pegatron. Using Omniverse, TSMC saves months in work by designing fabs virtually. Foxconn accelerates thermal simulations by 150x, and Pegatron reduced assembly line defect rates by 67%. Lastly with our automotive group. Revenue was $567 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust and demand for NAVs.

The platform speeds development of robotic imaging and surgery systems. The era of robotics is here, billions of robots, hundreds of millions of autonomous vehicles and hundreds of thousands of robotic factories and warehouses will be developed. All right. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61%, respectively. Excluding the $4.5 billion charge, Q1 non-GAAP gross margins would have been 71.3%, slightly above our outlook at the beginning of the quarter. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 7% and non- GAAP operating expenses were up 6%, reflecting higher compensation and employee growth. Our investments include expanding our infrastructure capabilities and AI solutions, and we plan to grow these investments 6 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

With half of the world's AI researchers based there, the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper Data Center business in China. We cannot reduce Hopper further to comply. As a result, we are taking a multibillion dollar write-off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. We are exploring limited ways to compete, but Hopper is no longer an option. China's AI moves on with or without US chips. It has to compute to train and deploy advanced models. The question is not whether China will have AI, it already does. The question is whether one of the world's largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chipmakers from US competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position. Export restrictions have spurred China's innovation and scale. The AI race is not just about chips. It's about, which stack the world runs on. As that stack grows to include 6G and quantum, US global infrastructure leadership is at stake. The US has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it's clearly wrong. China has 7 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q1 2026 Earnings Call 28-May-2025 enormous manufacturing capability. In the end, the platform that wins the AI developers wins AI. Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals. On DeepSeek, DeepSeek and Qwen from China are among the most – among the best open source AI models. Released freely, they've gained traction across the US, Europe and beyond. DeepSeek-R1, like ChatGPT, introduced reasoning AI that produces better answers, the longer it thinks.

Reasoning is compute-intensive, requires hundreds to thousands more – thousands of times more tokens per task than previous one-shot inference. Reasoning models are driving a step-function surge in inference demand. AI scaling laws remain firmly intact, not only for training, but now inference too, requires massive scale compute. DeepSeek also underscores the strategic value of open source AI. When popular models are trained and optimized on US platforms, it drives usage, feedback and continuous improvement, reinforcing American leadership across the stack. US platforms must remain the preferred platform for open source AI. That means supporting collaboration with top developers globally, including in China. America wins when models like DeepSeek and Qwen runs best on American infrastructure. Regarding onshore manufacturing, President Trump has outlined a bold vision to reshore advanced manufacturing, create jobs and strengthen national security. Future plants will be highly computerized in robotics. We share this vision. TSMC is building six fabs and two advanced packaging plants in Arizona to make chips for NVIDIA. Process qualification is underway with volume production expected by year-end. SPIL and Amkor are also investing in Arizona, constructing packaging, assembly, and test facilities. In Houston, we're partnering with Foxconn to construct a million square foot factory to build AI supercomputers. Wistron is building a similar plant in Fort Worth, Texas. To encourage and support these investments, we've made substantial long-term purchase commitments, a deep investment in America's AI manufacturing future. Our goal from chip to supercomputer built in America within a year. Each GB200 NVLink72 racks contains 1.2 million components and weighs nearly 2 tons. No one has produced supercomputers on this scale. Our partners are doing an extraordinary job. On AI diffusion rule, President Trump rescinded the AI diffusion rule, calling it counterproductive, and proposed a new policy to promote US AI tech with trusted partners. On his Middle East tour, he announced historic investments. I was honored to join him in announcing a 500 megawatt AI infrastructure project in Saudi Arabia and a 5 gigawatt AI campus in the UAE.

The US will always be NVIDIA's largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure. Every nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution, a new industry that produces intelligence and essential infrastructure for every economy. Countries are racing to build national AI platforms to elevate their digital capabilities. At COMPUTEX, we announced Taiwan's first AI factory in partnership with Foxconn and the Taiwan government. Last week, I was in Sweden to launch its first national AI infrastructure. Japan, Korea, India, Canada, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and more are now building national AI factories to empower startups, industries and societies.

Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Well, we would like to serve all of it, and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through is 1,000 times more than a one-shot chatbot. It's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step-by-step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so what we would like to do, and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so this is going to be a huge benefit in driving down the cost, while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. So that's the fundamental reason. That was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell NVLink72. Of course, in order to do that, we had to reinvent, literally redesign, the entire way that these supercomputers are built. But now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Just what are your customer discussions telling you about how to model growth for next year? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. A Yes, Vivek. Thanks so much for the question regarding H20. Yes, we recognized $4.6 billion H20 in Q1. We were unable to ship $2.5 billion, so the total for Q1 should have been $7 billion. When we look at our Q2, our Q2 is going to be meaningfully down in terms of China Data Center revenue. And we had highlighted in terms of the amount of orders that we had planned for H20 in Q2, and that was $8 billion. Now going forward, we did have other orders going forward that we will not be able to fulfill. That is what was incorporated therefore in the amount that we wrote down of the $4.5 billion. That write-down was about inventory and purchase commitments, and our purchase commitments were about what we expected regarding the orders that we had received.

Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Vivek, the – probably the best way to think through it is that AI is several things. Of course, we know that AI is this incredible technology that's going to transform every industry from, of course, the way we do software to healthcare and financial services to retail to, I guess, every industry, transportation, manufacturing, and we're at the beginning of that. But maybe another way to think about that is where do we need intelligence, where do we need digital intelligence? And it's in every country, it's in every industry. And we know because of that, we recognize that AI is also an infrastructure. It's a way of developing a technology – delivering a technology that requires factories and these factories produce tokens. And they – as I mentioned are important to every single industry and every single country. And so on that basis, we're really at the very beginning of it, because the adoption of this technology is really kind of in its early, early stages. Now we've reached an extraordinary milestone with AIs that are reasoning or thinking, what people call inference time scaling. Of course, it created a whole new – we've entered an era where inference is going to be a significant part of the compute workload. But anyhow, it's going to be a new infrastructure, and we're building it out in the cloud. The United States is really the early starter and available in US clouds. And this is our largest market, our largest installed base and we continue to see that happening. But beyond that, we're going to have to – we're going to see AI go into enterprise, which is on-prem because so much of the data is still on-prem. Access control is really important. It's really hard to move all of every company's data into the cloud. And so we're going to move AI into the enterprise.

And you saw that we announced a couple of really exciting new products, our RTX PRO enterprise AI server that runs everything enterprise and AI, our DGX Spark and DGX Station, which is designed for developers who want to work on-prem. And so enterprise AI is just taking off. Telcos. Today, a lot of the telco infrastructure will be in the future software defined and built on AI, and so 6G is going to be built on AI and that infrastructure needs to be built out. And as I said, it's very, very early stages. And then, of course, every factory today that makes things will have an AI factory that sits with it. And the AI factory is going to be – drive creating AI and operating AI for the factory itself, but also to power the products and the things that are made by the factory. So it's very clear that every car company will have AI factories. And very soon, there'll be robotics companies, robot companies and those companies will be also building AIs to drive the robots. And so we're at the beginning of all of this build-out. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

There have been many large GPU cluster investment announcements in the last month, and you alluded to a few of them with Saudi Arabia, the UAE.

And perhaps more importantly, how are these orders impacting your lead times for Blackwell and your current visibility sitting here today almost halfway through 2025? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A While we have more orders today than we did at the last time I spoke about orders at GTC. However, we're also increasing our supply chain and building out our supply chain. They're doing a fantastic job. We're building it here onshore in the United States. But we're going to keep our supply chain quite busy for several – many more years coming. And with respect to further announcements, I'm going to be on the road next week through Europe. And it's – just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure and their umpteenth AI factories being planned. I think in the remarks, Colette mentioned there's some 100 AI factories being built. There's a whole bunch that haven't been announced. And I think the important concept here which makes it easier to understand is that like other technologies that impact literally every single industry, of course, electricity was one and it became infrastructure. Of course, the information infrastructure, which we now know as the internet affects every single industry, every country, every society. Intelligence is surely one of those things. I don't know any company, industry, country who thinks that intelligence is optional. It's essential infrastructure. And so we've now digitalized intelligence. And so I think we're clearly in the beginning of the build-out of this infrastructure. And every country will have it, I'm certain of that. Every industry will use it, that I'm certain of. And what's unique about this infrastructure is that it needs factories. It's a little bit like the energy infrastructure, electricity. It needs factories. We need factories to produce this intelligence, and the intelligence is getting more sophisticated. We were talking about earlier that we had a huge breakthrough in the last couple of years with reasoning AI. And now","metadata":{"chunk_id":"4e2f67030a2d","file_name":"nvidia1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia1.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":5440,"end_word_idx":5840}}

We were talking about earlier that we had a huge breakthrough in the last couple of years with reasoning AI. And now there are agents that reason and there are super-agents that use a whole bunch of tools and then there's clusters of super agents where agents are working with agents, solving problems. And so you could just imagine, compared to one-shot chatbots and the agents that are now using AI built on these large language models, how much more compute-intensive they really need to be and are. So I think we're in the beginning of the build-out, and there should be many, many more announcements in the future. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Ben Reitzes Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask, first to Colette, just a little clarification around the guidance and maybe putting it in a different way. The $8 billion for H20 just seems like it's roughly $3 billion more than most people thought with regard to what you'd be foregoing in the second quarter. So that would mean that with regard to your guidance, the rest of the business in order to hit $45 billion is doing $2 billion to $3 billion or so better. So I was wondering if that math made sense to you. And then in terms of the guidance, that would imply the non- China business is doing a bit better than the Street expected. So wondering what the primary driver was there in your view. And then this second part of my question, Jensen, I know you guide one quarter at a time, but with regard to the AI diffusion rule being lifted and this momentum with sovereign, there's been times in your history where you guys 11 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

(NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q1 2026 Earnings Call 28-May-2025 have said on calls like this, where you have more conviction in sequential growth throughout the year, et cetera. And given the unleashing of demand with AI diffusion being revoked and the supply chain increasing, does the environment give you more conviction in sequential growth as we go throughout the year? So first one for Colette, and then next one for Jensen. Thanks so much. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. A Thanks, Ben, for the question. When we look at our Q2 guidance and our commentary that we provided that had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about $8 billion for H20, that's correct. That was a possibility for what we would have had in our outlook for this quarter in Q2. So what we also have talked about here is the growth that we've seen in Blackwell, Blackwell across many of our customers, as well as the growth that we continue to have in terms supply that we need for our customers. So putting those together, that's where we came through with the guidance that we provided. I'm going to turn the rest over to Jensen to see how he wants to [indiscernible] (00:49:05)... ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ben. I would say compared to the beginning of the year, compared to GTC timeframe, there are four positive surprises. The first positive surprise is the step function demand increase of reasoning AI. I think it is fairly clear now that AI is going through an exponential growth, and reasoning AI really busted through. Concerns about hallucination or its ability to really solve problems, and I think a lot of people are crossing that barrier and realizing how incredibly effective agentic AI is and reasoning AI is. So number one is inference reasoning and the exponential growth there, demand growth. The second one, you mentioned AI diffusion. It's really terrific to see that","metadata":{"chunk_id":"82f16bc74495","file_name":"nvidia1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia1.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":6080,"end_word_idx":6480}}

Concerns about hallucination or its ability to really solve problems, and I think a lot of people are crossing that barrier and realizing how incredibly effective agentic AI is and reasoning AI is. So number one is inference reasoning and the exponential growth there, demand growth. The second one, you mentioned AI diffusion. It's really terrific to see that the AI diffusion rule was rescinded. President Trump wants America to win, and he also realizes that we're not the only country in the race. And he wants the United States to win and recognizes that we have to get the American stack out to the world and have the world build on top of American stacks instead of alternatives. And so AI diffusion happened, the rescinding of it happened at almost precisely the time that countries around the world are awakening the importance of AI as an infrastructure, not just as a technology of great curiosity and great importance, but infrastructure for their industries and start-ups and society. Just as they had to build out infrastructure for electricity and internet, you got to build out an infrastructure for AI. I think that, that's an awakening, and that creates a lot of opportunity. The third is enterprise AI. Agents work and agents are doing – these agents are really quite successful, much more than generative AI. Agentic AI is game-changing. Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions and able to problem solve and use tools and have memory and so on. And so I think this is a – enterprise AI is ready to take off. And it's taken us a few years to build a computing system that is able to integrate and run enterprise AI stacks, run enterprise IT stacks, but add AI to it. And this is the RTX PRO enterprise server that we announced at COMPUTEX just last week. And just about every major IT company has joined us, super excited about that. And so computing is one stack, one part of it. But remember, enterprise IT is really three pillars, it's compute, storage and networking. And we've now put all three of them together finally, and we're going to market with that. And then lastly, industrial AI. Remember, one of the implications of the","metadata":{"chunk_id":"f435efc432b0","file_name":"nvidia1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia1.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":6400,"end_word_idx":6800}}

Remember, one of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is a regions on-shoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, of course, there are new electronics manufacturing, chip manufacturing being built around the world. And all of these new plants and these new factories are creating exactly the right time when Omniverse and AI and all the work that we're doing with robotics is emerging. And so this fourth pillar is quite important. Every factory will have an AI factory associated 12 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q1 2026 Earnings Call 28-May-2025 with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. And so these four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Timothy Arcuri Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q Thanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask about China. It sounds like the July guidance assumes there's no SKU replacement for the H20. But if the President wants the US to win, it seems like you're going to have to be allowed to ship something into China. So I guess I had two points on that. First of all, have you been approved to ship a new modified version into China? And you're currently building it but you just can't ship it in fiscal Q2? And then you were sort of run rating $7 billion to $8 billion a quarter into China. Can we get back to those sorts of quarterly run rates once you get something that you're allowed to ship back into China? I think we're all trying to figure out how much to add back to our models and when. So whatever you can say there would be great.","metadata":{"chunk_id":"1b2c7861638a","file_name":"nvidia1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia1.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":6720,"end_word_idx":7120}}

Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A The President has a plan. He has a vision and I trust him. With respect to our export controls, it's a set of limits. And the new set of limits pretty much make it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further for any productive use. And so the new limits, it's kind of the end the road for Hopper. We have limited options. And so we just – the key is to understand the limits. The key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don't have anything at the moment, but we're considering it. We're thinking about it. Obviously, the limits are quite stringent at the moment. And we have nothing to announce today. And when the time comes, we'll engage the administration and discuss that. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jake Wilhelm Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q Hi, this is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering, if you could give some additional color around the strength you saw within the networking business, particularly around the adoption of your Ethernet solutions at CSPs, as well as any change you're seeing in network attach rates? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah, thank you for that. We now have three networking platforms, maybe four. The first one is the scale-up platform to turn a computer into a much larger computer. Scaling up is incredibly hard to do. Scaling out is easier to do but scaling up is hard to do. And that platform is called NVLink. And NVLink is – comes with it chips","metadata":{"chunk_id":"0ea5b49714e5","file_name":"nvidia1.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia1.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":7040,"end_word_idx":7440}}

And that platform is called NVLink. And NVLink is – comes with it chips and switches and NVLink spines and it's really complicated. But anyways, that's our new platform, scale-up platform. In addition to InfiniBand, we also have Spectrum-X. We've been fairly consistent that Ethernet was designed for a lot of traffic that are independent. But in the case of AI, you have a lot of computers working together. And the traffic of AI is insanely bursty. Latency matters a lot, because the AI is thinking and it wants to get work done as quickly as possible, and you got a whole bunch of nodes working together. 13 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q1 2026 Earnings Call 28-May-2025 And so we enhanced Ethernet, added capabilities like extremely low latency, congestion control, adaptive routing, the type of technologies that were available only in InfiniBand to Ethernet. And as a result, we improved the utilization of Ethernet in these clusters. These clusters are gigantic from as low as 50% to as high as 85%, 90%. And so the difference is if you had a cluster that's $10 billion and you improved its effectiveness by 40%, that's worth $4 billion. It's incredible. And so Spectrum-X has been really, quite frankly a home run. And this last quarter, as we said in the prepared remarks, we added two very significant CSPs to the Spectrum-X adoption. And then the last one is BlueField, which is our control plane and so in those four – those – the control plane and network, which is used for storage. It's used for security and for many of these clusters that want to achieve isolation among its users, multi-tenant clusters and still be able to use and have extremely high-performance bare metal performance, BlueField is ideal for that and it is used in a lot of these cases.

Jensen Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. Thank you. This is the start of a powerful new wave of growth. Grace Blackwell is in full production. We're off to the races. We now have multiple significant growth engines. Inference, once the lighter workload is surging with revenue generating AI services. AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the internet, mobile and cloud. Blackwell is built to power the full AI lifecycle from training frontier models to running complex inference and reasoning agents at scale. Training demand continues to rise with breakthroughs in post training and like reinforcement learning and synthetic data generation. But inference is exploding. Reasoning AI agents require orders of magnitude more compute. The foundations of our next growth platforms are in place and ready to scale. Sovereign AI, nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and internet. Enterprise AI, AI must be deployable on-prem and integrated with existing IT. Our RTX PRO, DGX Spark and DGX Station enterprise AI systems are ready to modernize the $500 billion IT infrastructure on-prem or in the cloud. Every major IT provider is partnering with us. Industrial AI from training to digital twin simulation to deployment, NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac GR00T are powering next-generation factories and humanoid robotic systems worldwide.

Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. Thank you, Toshiya. We delivered another record quarter while navigating what continues to be a dynamic external environment. Total revenue was $46.7 billion, exceeded our outlook as we grew sequentially across all market platforms. Data Center revenue grew 56% year-over-year. Data Center revenue also grew sequentially, despite the $4 billion decline in H20 revenue. NVIDIA's Blackwell platform reached record levels, growing sequentially by 17%. We began production shipments of GB300 in Q2. Our full-stack AI solutions for cloud service providers, neoclouds, enterprises and sovereigns are all contributing to our growth. We are at the beginning of an industrial revolution that will transform every industry. We see $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by the end of the decade. The scale and scope of these build-outs present significant long-term growth opportunities for NVIDIA. The GB200 NVL system is seeing widespread adoption with deployments at CSPs and consumer Internet companies. Lighthouse model builders, including OpenAI, Meta and Mistral, are using the GB200 NVL72 at data center scale for both training next-generation models and serving inference models in production. The new Blackwell Ultra platform has also had a strong quarter, generating tens of billions in revenue.

The transition to the GB300 has been seamless for major cloud service providers due to its shared architecture, software and physical footprint, with the GB200 enabling them to build and deploy GB300 racks with ease. The transition to the new GB300 rack-based architecture has been seamless. Factory builds in late July and early August were successfully converted to support the GB300 ramp, and today, full production is underway. The current run rate is back at full speed, producing approximately 1,000 racks per week. This output is expected to accelerate even further throughout the third quarter, as additional capacity comes online. We expect widespread market availability in the second half of the year as CoreWeave prepares to bring their GB300 instance to market as they are already seeing 10x more inference performance on reasoning models compared to H100. Compared to the previous Hopper generation, GB300 NVL72 AI factories promise a 10x improvement in token per watt energy efficiency, which translates to revenues as data centers are power limited. The chips of the Rubin platform are in fab, the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, CX9 SuperNIC, NVLink 144 scale-up switch, Spectrum-X scale out and scale across switch, and the silicon photonics processor. Rubin remains on schedule for volume production next year. Rubin will be our third generation NVLink rack-scale AI supercomputer with a mature and full scale supply chain. This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems and software. 3 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 In late July, the US government began reviewing licenses for sales of H20 to China customers. While a select number of our China-based customers have received licenses over the past few weeks, we have not shipped any H20 based on those licenses.

While a select number of our China-based customers have received licenses over the past few weeks, we have not shipped any H20 based on those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement. We have not included H20 in our Q3 outlook as we continue to work through geopolitical issues. If geopolitical issues reside, we should (sic) [could] ship $2 billion to $5 billion in H20 revenue in Q3. And if we had more orders, we can bill more. We continue to advocate for the US government to approve Blackwell for China. Our products are designed and sold for beneficial commercial use, and every licensed sale we make will benefit the US economy, the US leadership. In highly competitive markets, we want to win the support of every developer. America's AI technology stack can be the world standard if we race and compete globally. Notably in the quarter was an increase in Hopper 100 and H200 shipments. We also sold approximately $650 million of H20 in Q2 to an unrestricted customer outside of China. The sequential increase in Hopper demand indicates the breadth of data center workloads that run on accelerated computing and the power of CUDA libraries and full-stack optimizations, which continuously enhance the performance and economic value of our platform. As we continue to deliver both Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, we are focusing on meeting the soaring global demand. This growth is fueled by capital expenditures from the cloud to enterprises, which are on track to invest $600 billion in data center infrastructure and compute this calendar year alone, nearly doubling in two years. We expect annual AI infrastructure investments to continue growing, driven by the several factors: reasoning agentic AI requiring orders of magnitude more training and inference compute, global build-outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of physical AI and robotics. Blackwell has set the benchmark as it is the new standard for AI inference performance. The market for AI inference is expanding rapidly, with reasoning and agentic AI gaining traction across industries.

Blackwell's rack- scale NVLink and CUDA full-stack architecture addresses this by redefining the economics of inference. New NVFP4 4-bit precision and NVLink 72 on the GB300 platform delivers a 50x increase in energy efficiency per token compared to Hopper, enabling companies to monetize their compute at unprecedented scale. For instance, a $3 million investment in GB200 infrastructure can generate $30 million in token revenue, a 10x return. NVIDIA's software innovation, combined with the strength of our developer ecosystem, has already improved Blackwell's performance by more than 2x since its launch. Advances in CUDA, TensorRT-LLM and Dynamo are unlocking maximum efficiency. CUDA library contributions from the open source community, along with NVIDIA's open libraries and frameworks, are now integrated into millions of workflows. This powerful flywheel of collaborative innovation between NVIDIA and global community contribution strengthens NVIDIA's performance leadership. NVIDIA is a top contributor to OpenAI models, data and software. Blackwell has introduced a groundbreaking numerical approach to large language model pre-training. Using NVFP4, computations on the GB300 can now achieve 7x faster training than the H100, which uses FP8. This innovation delivers the accuracy of 16-bit precision with the speed and efficiency of 4-bit, setting a new standard for AI factor efficiency and scalability. The AI industry is quickly adopting this revolutionary technology with major players such as AWS, Google Cloud, 4 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Nearly 90 companies, including many global leaders, are already adopting RTX PRO servers. Hitachi uses them for real-time simulation and digital twins, Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation, and Disney for immersive story telling. As enterprises modernize data centers, RTX PRO servers are poised to become a multibillion dollar product line. Sovereign AI is one on the rise as the nation's ability to develop its own AI using domestic infrastructure, data and talent presents a significant opportunity for NVIDIA. NVIDIA is at the forefront of landmark initiatives across the UK and Europe. The European Union plans to invest €20 billion to establish 20 AI factories across France, Germany, Italy and Spain, including 5 giga-factories to increase its AI compute infrastructure by 10-fold. In the UK, the Isambard-AI supercomputer powered NVIDIA was unveiled at the country's most powerful AI system, delivering 21 exaflops of AI performance to accelerate breakthroughs in fields of drug discovery and climate modeling. We are on track to achieve over $20 billion in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than double than that of last year. Networking delivered record revenue of $7.3 billion. And escalating demands of AI compute clusters necessitate high efficiency and low latency networking. This represents a 46% sequential and 98% year-on-year increase, with strong demand across Spectrum-X Ethernet, InfiniBand and NVLink. Our Spectrum-X enhanced Ethernet solutions provide the highest throughput and lowest latency network for Ethernet AI workloads. Spectrum-X Ethernet delivered double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth, with annualized revenue exceeding $10 billion. At Hot Chips, we introduced Spectrum-XGS Ethernet, a technology designed to unify disparate data centers into giga-scale AI super-factories. CoreWeave is an initial adopter of this solution, which is projected to double GPU-to-GPU communication speed.

(NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 Jetson Thor, our new robotics computing platform, is now available. Thor delivers an order of magnitude greater AI performance and energy efficiency than NVIDIA AGX Orin. It runs the latest generative and reasoning AI models at the edge in real time, enabling state-of-the-art robotics. Adoption of NVIDIA's robotics full-stack platform is growing at rapid rate. Over 2 million developers and 1,000-plus hardware, software applications and sensor partners taking our platform to market. Leading enterprises across industries have adopted Thor, including Agility Robotics, Amazon Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon, Medtronic and Meta. Robotic applications require exponentially more compute on the device and in infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for our Data Center platform. NVIDIA Omniverse with Cosmos is our data center physical AI digital twin platform built for development of robot and robotic systems.

Transitioning to a quick summary of our revenue by geography. China declined on a sequential basis to low- single digit percentage of Data Center revenue. Note, our Q3 outlook does not include H20 shipments to China customers. Singapore revenue represented 22% of second quarter's billed revenue as customers have centralized their invoicing in Singapore. Over 99% of Data Center compute revenue billed to Singapore was for US-based customers. Our Gaming revenue was a record $4.3 billion, a 14% sequential increase and a 49% jump year-on-year. This was driven by the ramp of Blackwell GeForce GPUs as strong sales continued as we increase supply availability. This quarter, we shipped GeForce RTX 5060 desktop GPU. It brings double the performance along with advanced ray tracing, neural rendering and AI-powered DLSS 4 gameplay to millions of gamers worldwide. Blackwell is coming to GeForce NOW in September. This is GeForce NOW's most significant upgrade, offering RTX 5080 class performance, minimal latency and 5K at 120 frames per second. We are also doubling the GeForce NOW catalog to over 4,500 titles, the largest library of any cloud gaming service. For AI enthusiasts, on-device AI performs the best RTX GPUs. We partnered with OpenAI to optimize their open source GPT models for high quality, fast and efficient inference on millions of RTX-enabled window devices. With the RTX platform stack, window developers can create AI applications designed to run on the world's largest AI PC user base. Professional Visualization revenue reached $601 million, a 32% year-on-year increase. Growth was driven by an adoption of the high-end RTX workstation GPUs and AI-powered workload like design, simulation and prototyping.

(NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 Now, moving to the rest of our P&L. GAAP gross margin was 72.4% and non-GAAP gross margin was 72.7%. These figures include a $180 million or 40 basis point benefit from releasing previously reserved H20 inventory. Excluding this benefit, non-GAAP gross margins would have been 72.3%, still exceeding our outlook. GAAP operating expenses rose 8% and 6% on a non-GAAP basis sequentially. This increase was driven by higher compute and infrastructure costs as well as higher compensation and benefit costs. To support the ramp of Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, inventory increased sequentially from $11 billion to $15 billion in Q2. While we prioritize funding our growth and strategic initiatives, in Q2, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends. Our board of directors recently approved a $60 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $14.7 billion of authorization at the end Q2. Okay. Let me turn it to the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. This represents over $7 billion in sequential growth. Again, we do not assume any H20 shipments to China customers in our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73.3%, 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. We continue to expect to exit the year with non-GAAP gross margins in mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.

Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. Thanks, CJ. At the highest level of growth drivers would be the evolution, the introduction, if you will, of reasoning agentic AI. Where chatbots used to be shot, you give it a prompt and it would generate the answer. Now, the AI does research. It thinks and does a plan, and it might use tools. And so it's called long thinking and the longer it thinks, oftentimes, it produces better answers. And the amount of computation necessary for one shot versus reasoning agentic AI models could be 100 times, 1,000 times and potentially even more as the amount of research and basically reading and comprehension that it goes off to do. And so the amount of computation that has resulted in agentic AI has grown tremendously. And of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously. Because of agentic AI, the amount of hallucination has dropped significantly. It can now use tools and perform tasks. Enterprises have been opened up. As a result of agentic AI and vision language models, we now are seeing a breakthrough in physical AI, in robotics, autonomous systems. So, the last year, AI has made tremendous progress and agentic systems, reasoning systems is completely revolutionary. Now, we built the Blackwell NVLink 72 system, a rack-scale computing system for this moment. We've been working on it for several years. This last year, we transitioned from NVLink 8, which is a node scale computing, each node is a computer, to now NVLink 72, where each rack is a computer. That disaggregation of NVLink 72 into a rack-scale system was extremely hard to do, but the results are extraordinary. We're seeing orders of magnitude speed up and therefore, energy efficiency and therefore, cost effectiveness of token generation because of NVLink 72.

The last couple of years, you have seen that CapEx has grown in just the top four CSPs by – has doubled and grown to about $600 billion. So we're in the beginning of this build-out, and the AI technology advances has really enabled AI to be able to adopt and solve problems to many different industries. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Colette, I just wanted to clarify, $2 billion to $5 billion in China, what needs to happen and what is the sustainable pace of that China business as you get into Q4? And then, Jensen, for you on the competitive landscape, several of your large customers already have or are planning many ASIC projects. I think one of your ASIC competitors, Broadcom signaled that they could grow their AI business almost 55%, 60% next year.

There is interest in our H20s. There is the initial set of license that we received. And then, additionally, we do have supply that we are ready, and that's why we communicated that somewhere in the range of about $2 billion to $5 billion this quarter we could potentially ship. We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues, going back and forth between the governments and the companies, trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do. So it's still open at this time, and we're not exactly sure what that full amount will be this quarter. However, if more interest arrives, more licenses arrives, again, we can also still build additional H20 and ship more as well. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A NVIDIA builds very different things in ASICs. So let's talk about ASICs first. A lot of projects are started. Many start-up companies are created. Very few products go into production. And the reason for that is it's really hard. Accelerated computing is unlike general-purpose computing. You don't write software and just compile it into a processor. Accelerated computing is a full-stack co-design problem. And AI factories in the last several years had become so much more complex because of the scale of the problems have grown so significantly. It is really the ultimate, the most extreme computer science problem the world's ever seen, obviously. And so the stack is complicated. The models are changing incredibly fast from generative based on autoregressive to generative based on diffusion to mixed models to multi-modality. The number of different models that are coming out that are either derivatives of transformers or evolutions of transformers is just daunting. One of the advantages that we have is that NVIDIA is available in every cloud. We're available from every computer company. We're available from the cloud to on-prem to edge to robotics on the same programming model. And so it's sensible that every framework in the world supports NVIDIA.

When you're building a new model architecture, releasing it on NVIDIA is most sensible. And so the diversity of our platform, both in the ability to evolve into any architecture, the fact that we're everywhere, and also, we accelerate the entire pipeline. Everything from data processing to pre-training to post- training with reinforcement learning, all the way out to inference. And so when you build a data center with NVIDIA platform in it, the utility of it is best. The lifetime usefulness is much, much longer. 9 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 And then I would just say that in addition to all of that, and it's just a really extremely complex systems problem anymore. People talk about the chip itself. There's one ASIC, the GPU that many people talk about. But in order to build Blackwell, the platform, and Rubin, the platform, we had to build CPUs that connect fast memory, low – extremely energy-efficient memory for large KV caching necessary for agentic AI to the GPU to a SuperNIC to a scale-up switch, we call NVLink, completely revolutionary. We're in our fifth generation now to a scale-out switch, whether it's Quantum or Spectrum-X Ethernet, to now scale across switches so that we could prepare for these AI super-factories with multiple gigawatts of computing, all connected together. We call that Spectrum-XGS. We just announced that at Hot Chips this week. And so the complications, the complexity of everything that we do is really quite extraordinary. It's just done at a really, really extreme scale now. And then, lastly, if I could just say one more thing. We're in every cloud for a good reason. Not only are we the most energy efficient.

And because our perf per dollar, the performance per dollar is so incredible, you also have extremely great margins. So the growth opportunity with NVIDIA's architecture and the gross margins opportunity with NVIDIA's architecture is absolutely the best. And so there's a lot of reasons why NVIDIA has chosen by every cloud and every start-up and every computer company.

Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Ben Reitzes Analyst, Melius Research LLC Q Hey. Thanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask you about your $3 trillion to $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spend by the end of the decade. Previously, you talked about something in the $1 billion range, which I believe was just for compute by 2028. If you take past comments, $3 trillion to $4 trillion would imply maybe $2 billion plus in compute spend. And just wanted to know if that was right and that's what you're seeing by the end of the decade. And wondering what you think your share will be of that. Your share right now of total infrastructure compute wise is very high. So I wanted to see. And also, if there's any bottlenecks you're concerned about like power to get to the $3 trillion to $4 trillion. Thanks a lot. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. Thanks. As you know, the CapEx of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years.

There's five years between now and the end of the decade, and $600 billion only represents the top four hyperscalers. We still have the rest of the enterprise companies building on-prem. You have cloud service providers building around the world. United States represents about 60% of the world's compute and over time, you would think that artificial intelligence would reflect GDP scale and growth and would be, of course, accelerating GDP growth. And so our contribution to that is a large part of the AI infrastructure. Out of a gigawatt AI factory, which can go anywhere from $50 billion to, plus or minus 10%, let's say, $50 billion to $60 billion, we represent about $35 10 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 billion, plus or minus, of that and $35 billion out of $50-or-so-billion per a gigawatt data center. And of course, what you get for that is not a GPU. I think people – we're famous for building the GPU and inventing the GPU. But as you know, over the last decade, we've really transitioned to become an AI infrastructure company. It takes six chips just to build – six different types of chips just to build a Rubin AI supercomputer. And just to scale that out to a gigawatt, you have hundreds of thousands of GPU compute nodes and a whole bunch of racks. And so we're really an AI infrastructure company. And we're hoping to continue to contribute to growing this industry, making AI more useful, and then very importantly, driving the performance per watt because the world, as you mentioned, limiters, it will always likely be power limitations or AI building limitations. And so we need to squeeze as much out of that factory as possible. NVIDIA's performance per unit of energy used drives the revenue growth of that factory. It directly translates.

Operator: Next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Joe Moore Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q Great. Thank you. Congratulations on reopening the China opportunity. Can you talk about the long-term prospects there? You've talked about, I think, half of AI software world being there. How much can NVIDIA grow in that business? And how important is it that you get the Blackwell architecture ultimately licensed there? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A The China market, I've estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year. If we were able to address it with competitive products and if it's $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year as the rest of the world's AI market is growing as well. It is the second largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China. The vast majority of the leading open source models are created in China. And so it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market. And open source, as you know, is created in one country, but it's used all over the world. The open source models that have come out of China are really excellent. DeepSeek, of course, gained global notoriety. Qwen is excellent. Kimi is excellent. There's a whole bunch of new models that are coming out. They're multimodal. They're great language models.

It has been really incredible for robotics around the world. And so open source is really important. And it's important that the American companies are able to address it. It's going to be a very large market. 11 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 We're talking to the administration about the importance of American companies to be able to address the Chinese market. And as you know, H20 has been approved for companies that are not on the entities list, and many licenses have been approved. And so I think the opportunity for us to bring Blackwell to the China market is a real possibility. And so we just have to keep advocating the sensibility of – and the importance of American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race and help make the American tech stack the global standard. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I want to go back to the Spectrum-XGS announcement this week and thinking about the Ethernet product now pushing over $10 billion of annualized revenue.

Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A We now offer three networking technologies. One is for scale up, one is for scale out, and one for scale across. Scale up is so that we could build the largest possible virtual GPU, the virtual compute node. NVLink is revolutionary. NVLink 72 is what made it possible for Blackwell to deliver such an extraordinary generational jump over Hopper's NVLink 8. At a time when we have long thinking, thinking models, agentic AI reasoning systems, the NVLink basically amplifies the memory bandwidth, which is really critical for reasoning systems. And so NVLink 72 is fantastic. We then scale out with networking, which we have two. We have InfiniBand, which is unquestionably the lowest latency, the lowest jitter, the best scale out network. It does require more expertise in managing those networks. And for supercomputing for the leading model makers, InfiniBand – Quantum InfiniBand is the unambiguous choice. If you were to benchmark an AI factory, the ones with InfiniBand are the best performance. For those who would like to use Ethernet, because their whole data center is built with Ethernet, we have a new type of Ethernet called Spectrum Ethernet. Spectrum Ethernet is not off the shelf. It has a whole bunch of new technologies designed for low latency and low jitter and congestion control. And it has the ability to come closer, much, much closer to InfiniBand than anything that's out there, thus we call that Spectrum-X Ethernet. And then, finally, we have Spectrum-XGS, a giga-scale for connecting multiple data centers, multiple AI factories into a super-factory, a gigantic system. And you're going to see that networking obviously is very important in AI factories. In fact, choosing the right networking, the performance, the throughput improvement going from 65% to 85% or 90%, that kind of step up because of your networking capability effectively makes networking free. Choosing the right networking, you're basically paying – you'll get a return on it like you can't believe because the AI factory, a gigawatt, as I mentioned before, could","metadata":{"chunk_id":"06532e2e90fa","file_name":"nvidia2.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia2.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":5760,"end_word_idx":6160}}

Choosing the right networking, you're basically paying – you'll get a return on it like you can't believe because the AI factory, a gigawatt, as I mentioned before, could be $50 billion. And so the ability to improve the efficiency of that factory by tens of percent results in $10 billion, $20 billion worth of effective benefit. And so the networking is a very important part of it. It's the reason why NVIDIA dedicate so much in networking. It's the reason why we purchased Mellanox 5.5 years ago. And Spectrum-X, as we mentioned earlier, is now quite 12 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q2 2026 Earnings Call 27-Aug-2025 a sizable business, and it's only about 1.5 years old. So Spectrum-X is a home run. All three of them are going to be fantastic. NVLink, scale up Spectrum-X and InfiniBand scale out, and then Spectrum-XGS for scale across. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Stacy A. Rasgon Analyst, Bernstein Research Q Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a more tactical question for Colette. So, on the guide, you're up over $7 billion, the vast bulk of that is going to be from Data Center. How do I think about apportioning that $7 billion across Blackwell versus Hopper versus Networking? I mean it looks like Blackwell was probably $27 billion in the quarter, up from maybe $23 billion last quarter. Hopper is still $6 billion or $7 billion post the H20. Like, do you think the Hopper strength continues? Just how do I think about parsing that $7 billion out across those three different components? .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Edward Schneider Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've been very clear about the reasoning model opportunity that you see, and you've also been relatively clear about the technical specs for Rubin. But maybe you could provide a little bit of context about how you view the Rubin product transition going forward? What incremental capability does that offer to customers? And would you say that Rubin is a bigger, smaller or similar step up in terms of performance from a capability perspective relative to what we saw with Blackwell? Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. Thanks, Rubin. Rubin, we're on an annual cycle.

To the extent that we have great ideas for every single generation, we could improve the revenue generation, improve the AI capability, improve the margins of our customers by releasing new architectures. And so we advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves and to build these data centers on an annual rhythm. And Rubin is going to have a whole bunch of new ideas. I pause for a second because I've got plenty of time between now and a year from now to tell you about all the breakthroughs that Rubin is going to bring. But Rubin has a lot of great ideas. I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now, and I'll save it for GTC to tell you more and more about it. But nonetheless, for the next year, we're ramping really hard into now Grace Blackwell, GB200, and then now Blackwell Ultra, GB300, we're ramping really hard into data centers. This year is obviously a record-breaking year. I expect next year to be a record-breaking year.

Thanks. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Well, I think the best way to look at it is we have reasonable forecasts from our large customers for next year, a very, very significant forecast. And we still have a lot of businesses that we're still winning and a lot of start-ups that are still being created. Don't forget that the number of start-ups for AI native start-ups was $100 billion was funded last year. This year, the year is not even over yet, it's $180 billion funded. If you look at AI native, the top AI native start-ups that are generating revenues, last year was $2 billion. This year is $20 billion. Next year being 10 times higher than this year is not inconceivable. And the open source models is now opening up large enterprises, SaaS companies, industrial companies, robotics companies to now join the AI revolution, another source of growth. And whether it's AI natives or enterprise SaaS or industrial AI or start-ups, we're just seeing just enormous amount of interest in AI and demand for AI.

And so I think the next several years, surely through the decade, we see just a really fast growing, really significant growth opportunities ahead. Let me conclude with this. Blackwell is the next-generation AI platform the world has been waiting for. It delivers an exceptional generational leap. NVIDIA's NVLink 72 rack-scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive order of magnitude increases in training and inference performance requirement. Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed and the demand is extraordinary. Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represents the Rubin platform. They have all taped out to TSMC. Rubin will be our third generation NVLink rack-scale AI supercomputer. And so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain. Our Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 trillion to $4 trillion global AI factory build out through the end of the decade. Customers are building ever greater scale AI factories from thousands of Hopper GPUs in tens of megawatt data centers to now hundreds of thousands of Blackwells in 100 megawatt facilities. And soon, we'll be building millions of Rubin GPU platforms, powering multi-gigawatt multi-site AI super- factories. With each generation, demand only grows.

Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. Thank you, Toshiya. We delivered another outstanding quarter with revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year and a record sequential revenue growth of $10 billion or 22%. Our customers continue to lean into three platform shifts; fueling exponential growth for accelerated computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications, yet we are still in the early innings of these transitions that will impact our work across every industry. We currently have visibility to a $0.5 trillion in Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of this year through the end of calendar year 2026. By executing our annual product cadence and extending our performance leadership through full-stack design, we believe NVIDIA will be the superior choice for the $3 trillion to $4 trillion in annual AI infrastructure build we estimate by the end of the decade. Demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations. The clouds are sold out and our GPU installed base, both new and previous generations, including Blackwell, Hopper, and Ampere, is fully utilized. Record Q3 Data Center revenue of $51 billion increased 66% year-over-year, a significant feat at our scale. Compute grew 56% year-over-year, driven primarily by the GB300 ramp, while networking more than doubled, given the onset of NVLink scale-up and robust double-digit growth across Spectrum-X Ethernet and Quantum-X InfiniBand.

The world hyperscalers, a trillion-dollar industry, are transforming search, recommendations and content understanding from classical machine learning to generative AI. NVIDIA CUDA excels at both and is the ideal platform for this transition driving infrastructure investment measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. At Meta, AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content, leading to more time spent on apps such as Facebook and Threads. Analyst expectations for the top CSPs and hyperscalers in 2026 aggregate CapEx have continued to increase and now sit roughly at $600 billion, more than $200 billion higher relative to the start of the year. We see the transition to accelerated computing and generative AI across current hyperscale workloads contributing toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity. Another growth pillar is the ongoing increase in compute spend driven by foundation model builders such as Anthropic, Mistral, OpenAI, Reflection, Safe Superintelligence, Thinking Machines Lab, and xAI, all scaling compute aggressively to scale intelligence. The three scaling laws – pre-training, post-training, and inference – remain intact. In fact, we see a positive virtuous cycle emerging whereby the three scaling laws and access to compute are generating better intelligence and, in turn, increasing adoption and profits. 3 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

The world's most important enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow, CrowdStrike, and SAP are integrating NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI stack. Our new partner, Palantir, is supercharging the incredibly popular Ontology platform with NVIDIA CUDA-X libraries and AI models for the first time. Previously, like most enterprise software platforms, ontology runs only on CPUs. Lowe's is leveraging the platform to build supply chain agility, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction. Enterprises broadly are leveraging AI to boost productivity, increase efficiency and reduce cost. RBC is leveraging agentic AI to drive significant analyst productivity, slashing report generation time from hours to minutes. AI and digital twins are helping Unilever accelerate content creation by 2X and cut costs by 50%. And Salesforce's engineering team has seen at least 30% productivity increase in new co-development after adopting Cursor. This past quarter, we announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs. This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders, enterprises and supercomputing centers, and includes multiple landmark build-outs, xAI's Colossus 2, the world's first gigawatt scale data center, Lilly's AI factory for drug discovery, the pharmaceutical industry's most powerful data center. And just today, AWS and HUMAIN expanded their partnership, including the deployment of up to 150,000 AI accelerators, including our GB300. xAI and HUMAIN also announced a partnership in which the two will jointly develop a network of world-class GPU data centers anchored by the flagship 500-megawatt facility. Blackwell gained further momentum in Q3, as GB300 crossed over GB200 and contributed roughly two-thirds of the total Blackwell revenue. The transition to GB300 has been seamless with production shipments to the majority – to the major cloud service providers, hyperscalers and GPU clouds, and is already driving their growth. The Hopper platform, in its 13th quarter since exception, recorded approximately $2 billion in revenue in Q3. H20 sales were approximately $50 million.

Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China. While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world. To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China. The Rubin platform is on track to ramp in the second half of 2026. Powered by seven chips, the Vera Rubin platform will once again deliver an X factor improvement in performance relative to Blackwell. We have received silicon back from our supply chain partners and are happy to report that NVIDIA teams across the world are executing the bring up beautifully. Rubin is our third-generation rack scale system substantially redefined the manufacturability while remaining compatible with Grace Blackwell, our supply chain data center ecosystem and cloud partners have now mastered the build-to-installation process of NVIDIA's rack architecture. Our ecosystem will be ready for a fast Rubin ramp. 4 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Thanks to CUDA, the A100 GPUs we shipped six years ago are still running at full utilization today, powered by vastly improved software stack. We have evolved over the past 25 years from a gaming GPU company to now an AI data center infrastructure company. Our ability to innovate across the CPU, the GPU, networking and software, and ultimately drive down cost per token is unmatched across the industry. Our networking business purpose built for AI and now the largest in the world, generated revenue of $8.2 billion, up 162% year-over-year with NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X Ethernet, all contributing to growth. We are winning in data center networking, as the majority of AI deployments now include our switches with Ethernet GPU attach rates roughly on par with InfiniBand. Meta, Microsoft, Oracle and xAI are building gigawatt AI factories with Spectrum-X Ethernet switches and each will run its operating system of choice, highlighting the flexibility and openness of our platform. We recently introduced Spectrum-XGS, a scale across technology that enables gigascale AI factories. NVIDIA is the only company with AI scale up, scale-out and scale across platforms, reinforcing our unique position in the market as the AI infrastructure provider. Customer interest in NVLink Fusion continues to grow. We announced a strategic collaboration with Fujitsu in October, where we will integrate Fujitsu's CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs via NVLink Fusion, connecting our large ecosystems. We also announced a collaboration with Intel to develop multiple generations of custom data center and PC products, connecting NVIDIA and Intel's ecosystems using NVLink. This week at Supercomputing 2025, Arm announced that it will be integrating NVLink IP for customers to build CPU SoCs that connect with NVIDIA. Currently on its fifth generation, NVLink is the only proven scale-up technology available on the market today.

Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was just over 17%, higher than our guidance of 16.5% due to the strong US revenue. On our balance sheet, inventory grew 32% quarter-over-quarter, while supply commitments increased 63% sequentially. We are preparing for significant growth ahead, and feel good about our ability to execute against our opportunity set. Okay. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. At the midpoint, our outlook implies 14% sequential growth driven by continued momentum in the Blackwell architecture. Consistent with last quarter, we are not assuming any Data Center compute revenue from China. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.

Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Colette. There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different. As a reminder, NVIDIA is unlike any other accelerator. We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post- training to inference. And with our two-decade investment in CUDA-X acceleration libraries, we are also exceptional at science and engineering simulations, computer graphics, structured data processing, to classical machine learning. The world is going – is undergoing three massive platform shifts at once. The first time since the dawn of Moore's Law, NVIDIA is uniquely addressing each of the three transformations. The first transition is from CPU general purpose computing to GPU-accelerated computing, as Moore's Law slows. The world has a massive investment in non-AI software, from data processing to science and engineering simulations, representing hundreds of billions of dollars in compute – cloud computing spend each year. Many of these applications, which ran once exclusively on CPUs, are now rapidly shifting to CUDA GPUs. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point. Secondly, AI has also reached a tipping point, and is transforming existing applications while enabling entirely new ones. For existing applications, generative AI is replacing classical machine learning in search ranking, recommender systems, ad targeting, click-through prediction to content moderation, the very foundations of hyperscale infrastructure. Meta's GEM, a foundation model for ad recommendations trained on large-scale GPU clusters, exemplifies this shift. In Q2, Meta reported over a 5% increase in ad conversions on Instagram and 3% gain on Facebook feed, driven by generative AI-based GEM. Transitioning to generative AI represents substantial revenue gains for hyperscalers. 7 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC","metadata":{"chunk_id":"5ccdae619428","file_name":"nvidia3.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia3.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":2880,"end_word_idx":3280}}

(NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q3 2026 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2025 Now, a new wave is rising. Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning and using tools, from coding assistants like Cursor and Claude Code to radiology tools like Aidoc, legal assistants like Harvey, and AI chauffeurs like Tesla FSD and Waymo, these systems mark the next frontier of computing. The fastest-growing companies in the world today, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, Cursor, Lovable, Replit, Cognition AI, OpenEvidence, Abridge, Tesla, are pioneering agentic AI. So, there are three massive platform shifts. The transition to accelerated computing is foundational and necessary, essential in a post-Moore's Law era. The transition to generative AI is transformational and necessary, supercharging existing applications and business models. And the transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary, giving rise to new applications, companies, products and services. As you consider infrastructure investments, consider these three fundamental dynamics, each will contribute to infrastructure growth in the coming years. NVIDIA is chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions and thus so, for any form and modality of AI across all industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in the cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots, one architecture.

So as the quarter has wrapped up, are those still kind of the general parameters that there's $350 billion in the next kind of 14 months or so?

Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I'll start first with a response here on that. Yes, that's correct, we are working into our $500 billion forecast. And we are on track for that as we have finished some of the quarters, and now we have several quarters now in front of us to take us through the end of calendar year 2026. The number will grow. And we will achieve, I'm sure, additional needs for compute that will be shippable by fiscal year 2026. So we shipped $50 billion this quarter, but we would be not finished if we didn't say that we'll probably be taking more orders. 8 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

There's clearly a great deal of consternation around the magnitude of AI infrastructure build-outs and the ability to fund such plans and the ROI. Yet at the same time, you're talking about being sold out every stood up GP is taken. The AI world hasn't seen the enormous benefit yet from B300, never mind Rubin, and Gemini 3 just announced, Grok 5 coming soon. And so the question is this, when you look at that as the backdrop, do you see a realistic path for supply to catch up with demand over the next 12 to 18 months, or do you think it can extend beyond that timeframe? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Well, as you know, we've done a really good job planning our supply chain. NVIDIA supply chain basically includes every technology company in the world. And TSMC and their packaging and our memory vendors and memory partners and all of our system ODMs have done a really good job planning with us. And we were planning for a big year. We've seen for some time the three transitions that I spoke about just a second ago, accelerated computing from general purpose computing. And it's really important to recognize that AI is not just agentic AI, but generative AI is transforming the way that hyperscalers did the work that they used to do on CPUs. Generative AI made it possible for them to move search and recommender systems, and add recommendations and targeting. All of that has been moved to generative AI, and it's still transitioning. And so, whether you installed NVIDIA GPUs for data processing, or you did it for generative AI for your recommender system or you're building it for agentic chatbots and the type of AIs that most people see when they think about AI, all of those applications are accelerated by NVIDIA. So, when you look at the totality of the spend, it's really important to think about each one of those layers. They're all growing. They're related, but not the same, but the wonderful thing is that they all run on NVIDIA GPUs.

Simultaneously, because the quality of the AI models are improving so incredibly, the adoption of it in the different use cases, whether it's in code assistants, which NVIDIA uses fairly exhaustively, and we're not the only one.

And it's not just used for software engineers, it's used by – because of vibe coding, it's used by engineers and marketeers all over companies, supply chain planners, all over companies. And so I think that that's just one example and the list goes on, whether it's OpenEvidence and the work that they do in health care or the work that's being done in digital video editing Runway. And I mean, the number of really, really exciting start-ups that are taking advantage of generative AI and agentic AI is growing quite rapidly. And not to mention, we're all using it a lot more. And so, all of these exponentials, not to mention, just today, I was reading a text from Demis, and he was saying that pre-training and post-training are fully intact.

Vivek Arya Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, what assumptions are you making on NVIDIA content per gigawatt in that $500 billion number? Because we have heard numbers as low as $25 billion per gigawatt of content as high as $30 billion or $40 billion per gigawatt. So, I'm curious what power and what dollar per gig assumptions you are making as part of that $500 billion number? And then, longer term, Jensen, the $3 billion to $4 trillion in Data Center by 2030 was mentioned. How much of that do you think will require vendor financing, and how much of that can be supported by cash flows of your large customers or governments or enterprises? Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A In each generation, from Ampere to Hopper, from Hopper to Blackwell, Blackwell to Rubin, our part of the Data Center increases. And Hopper generation was probably something along the lines of $20-some-odd billion – $20 billion to $25 billion. Blackwell generation, Grace Blackwell particularly, is probably $30 billion to – say $30 billion plus or minus, and then Rubin is probably higher than that. And in each one of these generations, the speed-up is X factors. And therefore, their TCO, the customer TCO, improves by X factors. And the most important thing is, in the end, you still only have 1 gigawatt of power, 1 gigawatt data centers, 1 gigawatt power. And therefore, performance per watt, the efficiency of your architecture is incredibly important. And the efficiency of your architecture can't be brute-forced. There is no brute forcing about it. That 1 gigawatt translates directly. Your performance per watt translates directly, absolutely directly to your revenues, which is the reason why choosing the right architecture matters so much now. The world doesn't have an excess of anything to squander.

The world doesn't have an excess of anything to squander. And so, we have to be really, really – we use this concept called codesign across our entire stack, across the frameworks and models, across the entire data center, even power and cooling optimized across the entire supply chain in our ecosystem. And so, each generation, our economic contribution will be greater, our value delivered will be greater, but the most important thing is our energy efficiency per watt is going to be extraordinary every single generation. With respect to growing into – continuing to grow, our customers' financing is up to them. We are – we see the opportunity to grow for quite some time. And remember, today, most of the focus has been on the hyperscalers. And one of the areas that is really misunderstood about the hyperscalers is that the investment on NVIDIA GPUs not only improves their scale, speed, and cost for – from general purpose computing, that's number one, because Moore's Law scaling has really slowed. 10 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q3 2026 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2025 Moore's Law is about driving cost down. It's about deflationary cost, the incredible deflationary cost of computing over time, but that has slowed. Therefore, a new approach is necessary for them to keep driving the cost down. Going to NVIDIA GPU computing is really the best way to do so. The second is revenue boosting in their current business models, recommender systems drive the world's hyperscalers. Every single – whether it's watching short-form videos or recommending books or recommending the next item in your basket to recommending ads to recommending news to – it's all about recommenders. The world has – the Internet has trillions of pieces of content, how could they possibly figure out what to put in front of you in your little tiny screen, unless they have really sophisticated recommender systems to do so.

Well, that has gone generative AI. So, the first two things that I've just said, hundreds of billions of dollars of CapEx is going to have to be invested is fully cash flow funded. What is above it therefore is agentic AI. This is revenue – is net new, net new consumption, but it's also net new applications and some of the applications I mentioned before, but these are – these new applications are also the fastest-growing applications in history, okay. So, I think that you're going to see that once people start to appreciate what is actually happening under the water, if you will, from the simplistic view of what's happening to CapEx investment, recognizing there's these three dynamics. And then lastly, remember, we were just talking about the American CSPs. Each country will fund their own infrastructure. And you have multiple countries, you have multiple industries. Most of the world's industries haven't really engaged agentic AI yet, and they're about to. All the names of companies that you know we're working with, whether it's autonomous vehicle companies or digital twins for physical AI, for factories, and the number of factories and warehouses being built around the world, just a number of digital biology start-ups that are being funded so that we could accelerate drug discovery, all those different industries are now getting engaged, and they're going to do their own fundraising. And so, don't just look at the hyperscalers as a way to build out for the future. You got to look at world, you got to look at all the different industries, and enterprise computing is going to fund their own industry. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah, appreciate the question. Of course, using cash to fund our growth, no company has grown at the scale that we're talking about and have the connection and the depth and the breadth of supply chain that NVIDIA has. The reason why our entire customer base can rely on us is because we've secured a really resilient supply chain, and we have the balance sheet to support them. When we make purchases, our suppliers can take it to the bank. When we make forecast and we plan with them, they take us seriously because of our balance sheet. We're not making up the offtake. We know what our offtake is. And because they've been planning with us for so many years, our reputation and our credibility is incredible. And so, it takes really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that. So, that's number one. 11 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

If you look at the work that – the investments that we did with OpenAI, it's – of course, that relationship we've had since 2016, I delivered the first AI supercomputer ever made to OpenAI. And so, we've had a close and wonderful relationship with OpenAI since then, and everything that OpenAI does runs on NVIDIA today. So, all the clouds that they deploy in, whether it's training and inference, runs NVIDIA and we love working with them. The partnership that we have with them is one so that we could work even deeper from a technical perspective, so that we could support their accelerated growth. This is a company that's growing incredibly fast. And don't just look at what is said in the press. Look at all the ecosystem partners and all the developers that are connected to OpenAI, and they're all driving consumption of it, and the quality of AI that's being produced, huge step-up since a year ago. And so, the quality of response is extraordinary. So, we invest in OpenAI for deep partnership in co-development to expand our ecosystem and to support their growth. And, of course, rather than giving up a share of our company, we get a share of their company. And we invested in them in one of the most consequential, once-in-a-generation company that we have a share of. And so, I fully expect that investment to translate to extraordinary returns.

Post-training basically has found incredible algorithms for improving an AI's ability to break a problem down and solve a problem, step-by-step. And post-training is scaling exponentially. Basically, the more compute you apply to a model, the smarter it is, the more intelligent it is. And then, the third is inference. Inference, because of chain of thought, because of reasoning capabilities, AIs are essentially reading, thinking, before it answers. And the amount of computation necessary as a result of those three things has gone completely exponential. I think that it's hard to know exactly what the percentage will be at any given point in time and who. But, of course, our hope is that inference is a very large part of the market, because if inference is large, then what it suggests is that people are using it in more applications and they're using it more frequently. And that's – we","metadata":{"chunk_id":"9e7e44164aca","file_name":"nvidia3.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia3.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"General","start_word_idx":6400,"end_word_idx":6800}}

And that's – we should all hope for inference to be very large. And this is where Grace Blackwell is just an order of magnitude better, more advanced than anything in the world. The second best platform is H200, and it's very clear now that GB300, GB200and GB300 because of NVLink 72, the scale-up network that we have achieve. And you saw and Colette talked about in the SemiAnalysis benchmark. It's the largest single inference benchmark ever done and GB200, NVLink 72 is 10 times, 10 times to 15 times higher performance. And so, that's a big step up. It's going to take a long time before somebody is able to take that on. And our leadership there is surely multiyear. And so, I think I'm hoping that inference becomes a very big deal. Our leadership in inference is extraordinary. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Operator: The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Timothy Arcuri Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Q Thanks a lot. Jensen, many of your customers are pursuing behind the meter power, but like what's the single biggest bottleneck that worries you that could constrain your growth? Is it power or maybe it's financing or maybe it's something else like memory or even foundry? Thanks a lot. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And the reason for that, when you're growing at the rate that we are and the scale that we are, how could anything be easy? What NVIDIA is doing obviously has never been done before. And we've created a whole new industry. Now on the one hand, we are transitioning, computing from general purpose and classical or traditional computing to accelerated computing and AI. That's on one hand. On the other hand, we created a whole new industry called AI factories. The idea that in order for software to run, you need these factories to generate it, generate every single token instead of retrieving information that was pre- created. And so, I think this whole transition requires extraordinary scale. And all the way from the supply chain, of course, the supply chain, we have much better visibility and control over because obviously, we're incredibly good at managing our supply chain. We have great partners that we've worked with for 33 years. And so, the supply chain part of it, we're quite confident. Now looking down our supply chain, we've now established partnerships with so many players in land and power and shell. And of course, financing. These things – none of these things are easy, but they're all attractable and they're all solvable things. And the most important thing that we have to do is do a good job planning. We plan up the supply chain, down the supply chain. We have established a whole lot of partners. And so, we have lot of routes to market. And very importantly, our architecture has to deliver the best value to the customers that we have. And so, at this point, I'm very confident that NVIDIA's architecture is the best performance per TCO. It is the best performance per watt. And therefore, for any amount of energy that is delivered, our architecture will drive the most revenues. And I think the increasing rate of our success, I think that we're more successful this year at this point than we were last year at this point.

Operator: The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Stacy A. Rasgon Analyst, Bernstein Research Q Questions. Colette, I had some questions on margins. You said for next year, you're working to hold them in the mid-70s. So I guess, first of all, what are the biggest cost increase? Is it just memory or is it something else? What are you doing to work toward that? Is it – how much is like cost optimizations versus pre-buys versus pricing? And then also, how should we think about OpEx growth next year, given the revenues seem likely to grow materially from where we're running right now? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. A Thanks, Stacy. Let me see if I can start with remembering where we were with the current fiscal year that we're in. Remember, earlier this year, we indicated that through cost improvements and mix that we would exit the year in our gross margins in the mid-70s. We achieved that and getting ready to also execute that in Q4. So, now it's time for us to communicate where are we working right now in terms of next year. Next year, there are input prices that are well known in the industries that we need to work through. And our systems are by no means very easy to work with. There are tremendous amount of components in many different parts of it as we think about that. So, we're taking all of that into account, but we do believe if we look at working again on cost improvement, cycle 14 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2025 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Your second question is around OpEx. And right now, our goal in terms of OpEx is to really make sure that we are innovating with our engineering teams with all of business teams to create more and more systems for this market. As you know, right now, we have a new architecture coming out. And that means they are quite busy in order to meet that goal. And so, we're going to continue to see our investments on innovating more and more both our software, both our systems and our hard work to do so. I'll leave it – turn it to Jensen if he wants to add any couple more comments. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. I think – that's spot on. I think the only thing that I would add is remember that we plan, we forecast, we plan and we negotiate with our supply chain well in advance. Our supply chain have known for quite a long time our requirements. And they've known for quite a long time our demand, and we've been working with them and negotiating with them for quite a long time. And so, I think the recent surge obviously quite significant. But remember, our supply chain has been working with us for a very long time. It's a – so in many cases, we've secured a lot of supply for ourselves because, obviously, they're working with the largest company in the world in doing so. And we've also been working closely with them on the financial aspects of it and securing forecasts and plans and so on and so forth.

Aaron Rakers Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Jensen, the question is for you, as you think about the Anthropic deal that was announced and just the overall breadth of your customers. I'm curious if your thoughts around the role that AI ASICs or dedicated XPUs play in these architecture buildouts has changed at all? Have you seen – I think you've been fairly adamant in the past that some of these programs never really see deployments. But I'm curious if we're at a point where maybe that's even changed more in favor of just GPU architecture. Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. Thank you very much. And I really appreciate the question. So first of all, you're not competing against teams, you're – excuse me, again, as a company, you're competing against teams. And there just aren't that many teams in the world who are built, who are extraordinary at building these incredibly complicated things. Back in the Hopper day and Ampere days, we would build one GPU. That's the definition of an accelerated AI system. But today, we've got to build entire racks, entire – three different types of switches, a scale up, scale out, and scale across switch. And it takes a lot more than one chip to build a compute node anymore. Everything about that computing system because AI needs to have memory, AI didn't use to have memory at all. Now it has to remember things, the amount of memory and context it has is gigantic. The memory architecture implication is incredible.

(NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q3 2026 Earnings Call 19-Nov-2025 autoregressive, not to mention biological models that obeys the laws of physics, the list of different types of models have exploded in the last several years. And so, the challenge is the complexity of the problem is much higher. The diversity of AI models is incredibly large. And so, this is where, if I will say, there are five things that makes us special, if you will. The first thing, I would say that makes us special is that we accelerate every phase of that transition. That's the first space. That CUDA allows us to have CUDA-X for transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. We are incredibly good at generative AI. We're incredibly good at agentic AI. So, every single phase of that – every single layer of that transition, we are excellent at. You can invest in one architecture, use it across the board. You can use one architecture and not worry about the changes in the workload across those three phases. That's number one. Number two, we're excellent at every phase of AI. Everybody's always known that we're incredibly good at pre- training. We're obviously very good at post-training, and we're incredibly good as it turns out at inference because inference is really, really hard. How could thinking be easy? People think that inference is one shot and therefore, it's easy, anybody could approach the market that way. But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking as it turns out is quite hard. We're great at every phase of AI, the second thing. The third thing is we're now the only architecture in the world that runs every AI model, every frontier AI model, we run open source AI models incredibly well. We run science models, biology models, robotics models. We run every single model. We're the only architecture in the world that can claim that.

It doesn't matter whether you're autoregressive or diffusion-based. We run everything and we run it for every major platform, as I just mentioned. So, we run every model. And then, the fourth thing, I would say is that we're in every cloud. The reason why developers love us is because we're literally everywhere. We're in every cloud, we're in every – we can even make you a little tiny cloud called DGX Spark. And so, we're in every computer, we're everywhere from cloud to on-prem, to robotic systems, edge devices, PCs, you name it. One architecture, things just work, it's incredible. And then, the last thing, and this is probably the most important thing, the fifth thing is, if you are a cloud service provider, if you're a new company like HUMAIN, if you're a new company like CoreWeave or Nscale or Nebius or OCI for that matter. The reason why NVIDIA is the best platform for you is because our offtake is so diverse. We can help you with offtake. It's not about just putting a random ASIC into a data center. Where is the offtake coming from? Where is the diversity coming from? Where is the resilience coming from? The versatility of the architecture coming from? The diversity of capability coming from? NVIDIA has such incredibly good offtake because our ecosystem is so large. So, these five things, every phase of acceleration and transition, every phase of AI, every model, every cloud to on-prem, and of course, finally, it all leads to offtake. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. Thanks, Toshiya. We delivered another outstanding quarter with record revenue, operating income and free cash flow. Total revenue of $68 billion was up 73% year-over-year, accelerating from Q3. Growth on a sequential basis was also a record, as we added $11 billion in data center revenue across a diverse and expanding set of customers, including cloud providers, hyperscalers, AI model makers, enterprises and sovereign nations. Demand for our Blackwell architecture extreme co-designed at data center scale continues to strengthen as inference deployments grow, in addition to training. The transition to accelerated computing and the infusion of AI across existing hyperscale workloads continue to fuel our growth. Agentic and physical AI applications built on increasingly smarter and multimodal models are beginning to drive our financial performance. On a full year basis, data center generated revenue of $194 billion, up 68% year-over-year. We have now scaled our data center business by nearly 13x since the emergence of ChatGPT in fiscal 2023. We look ahead, we expect sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2026, exceeding what was included in the $500 billion 3 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

We believe we have inventory and supply commitments in place to address future demand, including shipments, extending into calendar 2027. Every data center is power constrained. Customers make critical architectural decisions based on performance per watt, given these constraints and the need to maximize AI factory revenue. SemiAnalysis declared NVIDIA Inference King as recent results from InferenceX reinforced our inference leadership, with GB300 NVL72 achieving up to 50x performance per watt and 35x lower cost per token, compared with Hopper. And continuous optimization of CUDA software helped deliver up to five times better performance on GB200 NVL72 just within four months. NVIDIA produces the lowest cost per token and data centers running on NVIDIA generate the highest revenues. Our pace of innovation, particularly at our scale, is unmatched, fueled by an annual R&D budget approaching $20 billion and our ability to extreme co-designed across compute and networking across chips, systems, algorithms and softwares. We intend to deliver X factor leaps in performance per watt every generation and extend our leadership position over the long term. Q4 data center revenue of $62 billion increased 75% year-over-year and 22% sequentially, driven primarily by sustained strength in Blackwell and the Blackwell Ultra ramp. With NVIDIA infrastructure in high demand, even Hopper and much of the six year old Ampere-based products are sold out in the cloud. Nearly a year has passed since the release of our Grace Blackwell NVL72 systems. Today, nearly nine gigawatts of infrastructure on Blackwell are deployed and consumed by the major cloud service providers, hyperscalers, AI model makers and enterprises. Networking, a cornerstone of our data center scale infrastructure offering, was a standout this quarter, generating $11 billion in revenue, up more than 3.5x year-over-year.

Demand for our scale up and scale out technologies reached record levels, both growing double digit sequentially, driven by strong adoption of NVLink, Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand. On a year-over-year basis, growth was driven primarily by NVLink 72 scale up switches as Grace Blackwell Systems accounted for roughly two-thirds of data center revenue in the quarter. NVLink scale up fabric has revolutionized computing and demonstrates the power of extreme co-design across all of the chips of the supercomputer and the full stack. In Q4, we announced that we will enable AWS with NVLink to integrate with their custom silicon. Momentum is strong with our Spectrum-X Ethernet scale up and scale across networking, as customers work to unify distributed data centers into integrated giga scale AI factories. For the full year, our networking business exceeded $31 billion in revenue, up more than 10-x compared to fiscal 2021, the year we acquired Mellanox. Our demand profile is broad, diverse and expanding beyond just chatbots. First, there's a fundamental platform shift from classical machine learning to generative AI. Strong evidence of ROI as hyperscalers upgrade massive traditional workloads to generative AI, including search, ad generation and content recommender systems, is encouraging our largest customers to accelerate their capital spending. For example, at Meta, advancements in their GEM model drove a 3.5 increase in ad clicks on Facebook and more than 1% gain in conversations on Instagram, translating into meaningful revenue growth. With the same NVIDIA infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs can train and deploy their frontier agentic AI systems. Frontier agentic systems have reached an inflection point.

We continue to expect the transition of classic data center workloads to GPU accelerated computing, and the use of AI to enhance today's hyperscale workloads and contribute toward roughly half of our long-term opportunity. Every country will build and operate some parts of its AI infrastructure, just like with electricity and Internet today. In fiscal year 2026, our sovereign AI business, more than tripled year-over-year and over $30 billion, driven primarily by customers based in Canada, France, the Netherlands, Singapore and the UK. Over the long run, we expect our sovereign opportunity to grow at least in line with the AI infrastructure market, as countries spend on AI proportional to their GDP. While small amounts of H200 products for China-based customers were approved by the US government, we have yet to generate any revenue and we do not know whether any imports will be allowed into China. Our competitors in China, bolstered by recent IPOs, are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long-term. To sustain its leadership position in AI compute, America must engage every developer and be the platform for choice for every commercial business, including those in China. We will continue to engage with the US and China governments and advocate for America's ability to compete around the world. We unveiled the Rubin platform last month at CES, comprised of six new chips; the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink, 6 Switch, ConnectX-9, SuperNIC, BlueField-4 DPU, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. The platform will train MoE models with one-fourth the number of GPUs and reduce inference token costs by up to 10x compared to Blackwell.

Moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $3.7 billion increased 47% year-on-year, driven by strong Blackwell demand and improved supply. GeForce RTX is the leading platform for PC gamers, creators, and developers. In Q4, we added several new technologies and advancements, including DLSS 4.5, which uses AI to bring game visuals to a new level. G-SYNC Pulsar, bringing incredible clear graphics even in motion, and 35% faster LLM inference across leading AI PC frameworks. Looking ahead, while end demand for our products remains strong and channel inventory levels are healthy, we expect supply constraints to be the headwind to gaming in Q1 and beyond. For Professional Visualization, it crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time, with revenue of $1.3 billion, up 159% year-over-year and 74% sequentially. During the quarter, we launched the RTX PRO 5000 Blackwell Workstation with 72 gigabytes of fast memory for AI developers running LLMs and agentic workflows. 5 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Robotaxi rides are growing exponentially with commercial fleets from Waymo, Tesla, Uber, WeRide and Zoox, and many others are expected to scale from thousands of vehicles in 2025 to millions over the next decade, creating a market poised to generate hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue. This expansion will demand orders of magnitude more compute with every major OEM and service provider developing on NVIDIA's platform. We continue to advance robotics development with the new NVIDIA Cosmos and Isaac GROOT open models, frameworks and NVIDIA's powered robots and autonomous machines for leading companies, including Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Franka Robotics, LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics. To accelerate industrial physical AI adoption, we also announced new expanding partnerships with Dassault Systèmes, Siemens and Synopsys to bring NVIDIA AI infrastructure, Omniverse digital twins, world models and CUDA-X libraries to millions of researchers, designers and engineers building the world's industries. Let's move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 75%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 75.2%, increasing sequentially as Blackwell continued to ramp. GAAP operating expenses were up 16% sequentially and up 21% on a non-GAAP basis, related to new product introductions and compute and infrastructure costs. Non- GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.4%, below our outlook for the quarter, primarily due to the impact of a one-time tax benefit. Inventory grew 8% quarter-over-quarter, while purchase commitments also increased significantly, as we have strategically secured inventory and capacity to meet demand beyond the next several quarters. This is further out in time than usual and reflects the longer demand visibility we have. While we expect tightness in the supply for our advanced architectures to persist, we remain confident in our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunity ahead with our scale, expansive supply chain, and the longstanding partnerships continuing to serve us well. We generated free cash flow of $35 billion in Q4 and $97 billion in fiscal year 2026. For the year, we returned $41 billion, or 43% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.

Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Starting this quarter, we will be including stock-based compensation expense in our non-GAAP results. Stock-based compensation is a foundational component of our compensation program to attract and retain world class talent. Let me first start with revenue. Total revenue is expected to be $78 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect most of our growth to be driven by Data Center. Consistent with last quarter, we are not assuming any Data Center compute revenue from China in our outlook. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.9% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. For the full year, we continue to see gross margins in the mid-70s.

Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. This quarter we significantly deepened and expanded our partnerships with leading frontier model makers. We recently celebrated OpenAI's launch of GPT-5.3-Codex, trained with and inferencing on Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 systems. GPT-5.3-Codex can take on long running tasks that involve research, tool use, and complex execution. 5.3-Codex is deployed broadly inside NVIDIA, our engineers love it. We continue to work with OpenAI toward a partnership agreement and believe we are close. We are thrilled with our ongoing partnership with OpenAI, a once in a generation company we've had the pleasure of partnering with since their first days. Meta Superintelligence Labs is scaling up at lightning speed. Last week, we announced that Meta is deploying millions of Blackwells and Rubin GPUs, NVIDIA CPUs, and Spectrum-X Ethernet for training and inference. This quarter, we announced a partnership with Anthropic and a $10 billion investment in their company. Anthropic will train an inference on Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Anthropic's Claude Cowork agent platform is revolutionary and has opened a floodgates for enterprise AI adoption. Between Claude Cowork and OpenClaw, compute demand is skyrocketing and ChatGPT moment of agentic AI has arrived. With partnerships spanning Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, NVIDIA deployed across every cloud, and with our ability to build full-stack AI infrastructure from the ground up or support them in the cloud, we're uniquely positioned to partner with frontier model builders at every stage; training, inference, and AI factory scale out. Finally, we recently entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq for its low-latency inference technology, and welcomed a team of brilliant engineers to NVIDIA. As we did with Mellanox, we will extend NVIDIA's architecture with Groq's innovations to enable new levels of AI infrastructure performance and value.

Your line is open. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Vivek Arya Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc. Q Thanks for taking my question. I think you mentioned that you now have growth visibility into calendar 2027 also, and I think your purchase commitments kind of reflect that confidence. But Jensen, I'm curious, when you look at your top cloud customers, cloud CapEx close to $700 billion this year, many investors are concerned that it would be harder for this level to grow into next year. And for several of them, their cash flow generation capability is also getting compressed. So I know you're very confident about your roadmap, right, and your purchase commitments and whatnot, but how confident are you about your customers' ability to continue to grow their CapEx? And if their CapEx doesn't grow, can NVIDIA still find a way to grow in that envelope? Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A I am confident in their cash flow growing. And the reason for that is very simple. We have now seen the inflection of agentic AI and the usefulness of agents across the world in enterprises everywhere. You're seeing incredible compute demand because of it. In this new world of AI, compute is revenues. Without compute, there's no way to generate tokens. Without tokens, there's no way to grow revenues. So in this new world of AI, compute equals revenues. And I am certain that at this point, with the productive use of Codex and Claude Code and the excitement around Claude Cowork and, just the incredible enthusiasm about OpenClaw and the enterprise versions of them. All of the enterprise ISVs who are now working on agentic systems on top of their tools platforms, I am certain at this point that","metadata":{"chunk_id":"79ecdb6520de","file_name":"nvidia4.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia4.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":2880,"end_word_idx":3280}}

All of the enterprise ISVs who are now working on agentic systems on top of their tools platforms, I am certain at this point that we are at the inflection point. We've reached the inflection point, and we're generating profitable tokens that are productive for customers and profitable for the cloud service providers. And so the simple logic of it, the simple way to think about it is computing has changed. What used to be software running on computers, modest amount of computers, call it $300 billion or $400 billion worth of CapEx each year has now gone into AI and AI in order to have, in order to generate tokens, you need compute capacity. And that translates directly to growth and that translates directly to revenues. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Where is the Spectrum run rate trending now and as you foresee exiting sort of this calendar year? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. As you know, we see ourselves as an AI infrastructure company and the AI computing infrastructure includes CPUs, GPUs, and we invented NVLink to scale up the one computing node into a giant computing rack. We invented the idea of a rack scale computer. We don't ship nodes of computers, we ship racks of computers. And those – that NVLink Switch scale up system is then scaled out using Spectrum-X and InfiniBand, we support both. And then further, we also scale across data centers using Spectrum-X scale across. And so the way we think about networking is really an extension, it's – we offer everything openly, so that people could decide to mix and match in different scale, and however they would like to integrate it into their bespoke data center. But in the final analysis, it's all one big part of our platform. 9 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q4 2026 Earnings Call 25-Feb-2026 And the invention of NVLink really turbocharged our networking business. Every rack comes with nine nodes of switches, and each one of them has two chips in it and in the future they'll have more. And so the amount of switching that we do per rack is really quite incredible. We're also now the largest networking company in the world. And if you look at Ethernet, we came into the Ethernet market about a couple of years ago into Ethernet switching.

And I think that we're probably the largest Ethernet networking company in the world today, and surely will be soon. And so Spectrum-X Ethernet has been a home run for us. But we're open to however people want to do networking. Some people just really love the low latency and the scale up capability of InfiniBand. And we will continue to support that, of course. And some people love to integrate their networking across their data center based on Ethernet. And we created an Ethernet capability that extends Ethernet with artificial intelligence, way of processing in the data center and we're incredibly good at that and our Spectrum-X performance really shows it. The difference of when you built a $10 billion or $20 billion AI factory, the difference of 10%, and it could be easily 20% on the effectiveness and the utilization of your network for your data center that translates to real money. And so NVIDIA's networking business is really, really growing fast.

Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A We don't use – we want to – everybody should want to extend, push out dielet as long as they can. And the reason for that is because every time you cross a dielet you have a dielet, you have to cross an interface. Every time you cross an interface, you add latency, you add power unnecessarily. We're not allergic to dielet. We use dielets already. But we try to use dielets only when we absolutely have no choice but to do so. And so we – if you look at the Grace Blackwell architecture and the Rubin architecture, we used two giant reticle limited dies [ph] and we abut them (33:53) and that reduces the amount of architecture crossing. The [ph] dielet tax (33:59) shows up in the architecture effectiveness of the competitors. If you look at NVIDIA, people call it our software advantage. But where software starts and architecture starts and ends is kind of hard to tell. It's, our software is effective because our architecture is so good. And so the CUDA architecture is unquestionably more effective, more efficient, delivers more performance per flop, per watt than any computing architecture out there and it's because of the way we architect. With respect to, how we think about Groq and the low latency decoder, I've got some great ideas that I'd like to share with you at GTC, but the simple idea is that our infrastructure is incredibly versatile because of CUDA. And we're going to continue to do that. All of our GPUs are architecturally compatible, which means that when I'm working on optimizing models today for Blackwell, all of that work and all of that dedication to optimizing software stacks and new models, also benefit Hopper and also benefit Ampere. It's the reason why A100 continues to feel 10 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Stacy A. Rasgon Analyst, Bernstein Research Q Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I wanted to dig a little bit into the call for sequential growth through the year. So, I mean, you grew this quarter more than $10 billion sequentially in data center, and the guide seems to imply the bulk of the increase $10 billion sequential in data centers. So, how do you see that as we go through the year, especially as Rubin ramps into the back half? Blackwell has been a pretty massive acceleration with a sequential growth. Should we expect something similar as we get to Rubin? And then I was also just hoping you could comment on, your expectations for gaming? I understand the memory issues and everything else. Do you think gaming can still grow year-over-year in fiscal 2027, or will that be under more pressure given memory? So, those two questions, please. Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. A Thanks, Stacy. Let me start with the revenue going forward.

Again, we're trying to look at revenue quarter-by- quarter. As you think about the full year, we are absolutely going to be still selling and providing Blackwell probably at the same time that we're also seeing Vera Rubin come to market. This is a very great architecture that helps them just today quickly standing up and have already planned on many different orders across the different customers to provide that. It's too early yet to determine how much in terms of that Vera Rubin, that beginning ramp will start in the second half and we'll get through it. But no confusion in terms of the strong demand and the interest. We do expect pretty much every single customer to be purchasing Vera Rubin. The question is, are, how soon are we in market and how soon are they able to stand that up in terms of in their data centers? That was your first part. The second part was focusing on our gaming. As much as we would love to have additional more supply, we do believe for a couple quarters, it is going to be very tight. If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth. But it's still too early for us to know at this time. And we'll get back to you as soon as we can. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Without CUDA, we wouldn't know what to do with inference. The entire stack from TensorRT LLM that we introduced a few years ago, which is still the most performant inference stack in the world. Optimizing it for NVLink, requires us to discover and invent new parallelization algorithms that sits on top of CUDA, to distribute the workload and the inferencing to take advantage of the aggregate bandwidth across NVLink 72. NVLink 72 has enabled us to deliver generationally 50 times more performance per watt. It's just an incredible leap and it's sensible. NVLink 72 is a great invention. It was hard to do, the creation of the switching technology, disaggregating the switches, building the system racks, all of that. We did it all in plain sight and everybody knew how hard it was for us to do. And, but the results are incredible. So performance per watt is 50 times, performance per dollar, 35 times and so the leap in inference is incredible. It's very important – it's really important to realize that inference equals revenues now for our customers because agents are generating so many tokens and the results are so effective. When the agents are coding, it's off generating thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands because they're running for minutes to hours. And so these systems, these agentic systems are spawning off different agents working as a team. The number of tokens that are being generated has really, really gone exponential. And so, we need to inference at a much higher speed. And when you're inferencing at a much higher speed, and each one of those tokens are dollarized, it directly translates into revenues. And so inference equals, inference performance equals revenues for our customers. For the Data Centers, inference tokens per watt translates directly to the revenues of the CSPs. And the reason for that is because everybody is power limited. And so, I mean, no matter how many data centers you have, each data center, 100 megawatts or 1 gigawatt has power limits. So the architecture that has the best performance per watt translates","metadata":{"chunk_id":"2cffa881ceb9","file_name":"nvidia4.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia4.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":5440,"end_word_idx":5840}}

And so you could see that every CSP understands this now, every hyperscaler understands this, that CapEx translates to compute, compute with the right architecture translates to maximizing revenues and compute equals revenues. Without investing capacity today, without investing in compute, there cannot be revenue growth and that I think everybody understands. Compute equals revenues. Choosing the right architecture is incredibly important, is more than strategic now, it directly affects their earnings. And choosing the right architecture, the one with the best performance per watt is literally everything. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

My question is around gross margins and the sustainability of the mid-70s long-term. Should we read into the visibility on supply being available into calendar 2027 that it's sustainable until then? 12 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

If we can deliver performance per dollar dramatically more than the cost of our systems, than the price of our systems, then we can continue to sustain our gross margins. That's the simple, most important concept. Every – the reason why we're moving so fast is because number one, the demand for tokens in the world as a result of the inflection points that we've gone through has now – has gone completely exponential. I think we're all seeing that, to the point where even our six-year old GPUs in the cloud are completely consumed, and the pricing is going up. And so we know that the amount of computation necessary – the amount of compute necessary for the modern way of doing software is growing exponentially. And so our strategy is to deliver an entire AI infrastructure every single year. This year we introduced six new chips, Rubin next-generation will do many new chips as well. And every single generation, we are committed to deliver many X factors of performance per watt and performance per dollar. And that pace and our ability to do extreme co-design, allows us to deliver that value and that benefit to the customers. And that is the single most vital thing as it relates to our value delivered. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Well, the economics are poor today, but it's going to improve over time. As you know, the way that space works is radically different than how it works down here. There's an abundance of energy. But solar panels are large, but there's plenty of space in space. The heat dissipation -- it's cold in space. However, there's no airflow. And so the only way to dissipate heat is through conduction. And the radiators that you need to create are fairly large. Liquid cooling is obviously out of the question because it's kind of -- it's heavy and freezes. And so the methods that we use here on Earth are a little different than the way we would do it in space. But there are many different computing problems that really wants to be done in space. And so, NVIDIA is already the world's first GPU in space, Hopper's in space. And one of the best use cases of GPUs in space is imaging, to be able to image at extremely high resolutions using, of course, optics and artificial intelligence and to be able to do that computation of reprojection of different angles and be able to upres and do noise reduction and just be able to see, be able to image at very large, very high resolutions, extremely large scales, and very, very fast. It's hard to do that by sending petabytes and 13 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q4 2026 Earnings Call 25-Feb-2026 petabytes of imaging data back here on Earth and doing that work. It's easier just to do it out in space. And then, ignore all of the data collected and processed until you see something interesting.

I believe, Colette, you said that hyperscalers were over 50% of revenues, but growth was led by the rest of your Data Center customers. And as a clarification, I just want to make sure I understood that, does that imply your non-hyperscale customers grew faster. And if so, what are the – can you help us understand what are the non-hyperscalers doing different. Are they doing different things than the hyperscalers or the same things on a different scale and does this – do you expect this trend to continue? Would you expect your customer base to evolve to a point where non-hyperscalers are becoming a bigger part of your, the larger part of your business? Thank you. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Colette M. Kress Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NVIDIA Corp. A Yes. Let's see if we can help on this question. So when you think about our top five, as we articulated as being our CSPs, our hyperscalers, and they have right now, [ph] as I said (49:15) about 50% of our total revenue. There's a big organization, therefore, of diversity of all different other types of companies that we are working with. That it goes through our AI model makers, that goes through our enterprises, that goes to supercomputing, it goes to our sovereigns. There's a lot of other different facts on there. But you are correct, it's a very fast growing area as well. We have a strong position in terms of all of our different cloud providers on our platform, and now we also have a extreme diversity of different customers that we are seeing all the way across the world.

Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah, this is one of the advantages that we have with our ecosystem. I'll build on top of CUDA. We have -- we're the only accelerated computing platform that is in every cloud, that's available through every single computer maker, available at the edge and, we're now cultivating telecommunications. Obviously, the future radios will all be AI driven radios and the future wireless network would also be a computing platform. That is a foregone conclusion. But somebody has to go and invent the technologies to make that possible. And we created a platform called Aerial to go do that. We are in just about every single robot, every single self-driving car. Our ability – CUDA's ability to have the benefit of the performance of specialized processors, one the one hand, with the Tensor cores inside our GPUs, on the other hand, the flexibility of CUDA allows us to solve language problems, computer vision problems, robotics problems, to biology problems, physics problems, and just about all kinds of AI and all kinds of computation algorithms. And so the diversity of our customer base is one of the greatest strengths that we have. 14 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

Aaron Rakers Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC Q Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, sticking with the idea as a platform and extreme co-design, some of the news over this last quarter has obviously been NVIDIA's ability or push to bring Vera CPUs to market on a standalone solution basis. So, I guess, Jensen, I'm curious of what's the importance that Vera plays in this architecture evolution as we move forward? Is this being driven more by the proliferation or the heterogeneity of inference workloads? I'm just curious of how you see that evolving for NVIDIA, particularly on a standalone CPU basis?

And the single threaded performance and this ratio with bandwidth is just off the charts. And we made those architectural decisions because in the entire phase – the different phases of AI from data processing before you even do training, you have to do data processing. So, you have data processing, pre-training, and in post-training now the AI's are learning how to use tools and the usage of tools, many of those tools run in CPU-only environments or they run in CPU or GPU accelerated environments. And Vera was designed to be an excellent CPU for post-training and so some of the use cases in the entire pipeline of artificial intelligence includes using a lot of CPUs. 15 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp.

And we do believe that one of the most important things that we can do is really supporting the extreme ecosystem that's in front of us. That stems from everywhere, from our suppliers and the work that we need to do to assure that we can have the supply that's needed and help them from a capacity, all the way that we are in terms of the early developers of the AI solutions, that will be on our platform. So we will continue to make this a very important part of our process and strategic investments. But of course, we are still repurchasing our stock. We are still with our dividend as well.

James Edward Schneider Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Q Thank you for taking my question. Jensen, you've previously outlined the potential to get to $3 trillion to $4 trillion of data center CapEx by 2030, which implies a potential acceleration in growth rates, which you sort of guided to this, at least this next quarter.

Jen Hsun Huang Co-Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, NVIDIA Corp. A Yeah. Let's back that up and just reason through it from a few different ways. So the first way is on first principles. The way that software is done in the future using AI is token driven. And I think everybody talks about tokenomics and, talks about data centers generating tokens and inference is about generating tokens. And, we generate 16 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q4 2026 Earnings Call 25-Feb-2026 tokens. We're just talking about tokens. How NVIDIA's NVLink 72 enabled us to generate tokens at 50 times better performance per unit energy than the previous generation. And so token generation is at the center of almost everything that relates to software in the future and relates to computing. If you look at the way we use computing in the past, however, the amount of computation demand for software in the past is a tiny fraction of what is necessary in the future. And AI is here. AI is not going to go back. AI is only going to – only get better from here. And so if you think about it and you said, okay, well, the world was investing about $300 billion to $400 billion a year in classical computing. And now AI is here and the amount of computation necessary is a thousand times higher than the way we used to do computing, the computing demand is just a lot higher. And so if we continue to believe there's value in it, and we'll talk about that in a second, then the world will invest to produce that token. And so the amount of token generation capability that the world needs is a lot more than $700 billion. And I'm fairly confident that we're going to continue to generate tokens. We're going to continue to invest in compute capacity from this point out. And fundamentally, because every single company depends","metadata":{"chunk_id":"badd9f342240","file_name":"nvidia4.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia4.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":8320,"end_word_idx":8720}}

And so the amount of token generation capability that the world needs is a lot more than $700 billion. And I'm fairly confident that we're going to continue to generate tokens. We're going to continue to invest in compute capacity from this point out. And fundamentally, because every single company depends on software, every software will depend on AI, and so every company will produce tokens. And that's the reason why I call them AI factories. And whether you're a company in the cloud data centers, you have AI factories to generate tokens for your revenues. If you're a enterprise software company, you're going to generate tokens for the agentic systems that are on top of your tools. If you are a robotics factory and self-driving car's first indication of that, you have huge supercomputers, which are basically AI factories to generate tokens that goes into your cars, that becomes its AI. And then you also have to put computers inside the cars to continuously generate tokens. And so, we're fairly sure now that this is the future of computing. Now, why is it so certain that this is the future of computing? And the reason for that is because the way we used to do software was pre-recorded. Everything was captured a priori. We pre-compile the software, we pre-write the content, we pre-record the videos. But now everything is generative in real-time. And when it's generated in real- time, it can take into context of the person, the situation, the query, and the intentions could all be taken into consideration to generate the outcome of this new software we call AI, agentic AI. And so the amount of computation necessary is far, far greater than prerecorded, just as a computer has a lot more computation capability than a DVD recorder, a DVD player that was pre-recorded, artificial intelligence needs a lot more computing capability than the way we used to do software in the past. Now, the question about computation, about sustainability at the first level is just at the computer science level, this is the way computing is going to be done.

Now, the question about computation, about sustainability at the first level is just at the computer science level, this is the way computing is going to be done. Now, from an industrial level, because all of our companies, in the final analysis are powered by software and the cloud companies are powered by software. And if the new software requires tokens to be generated and the tokens are monetized, then it stands to reason that their data center build-out directly drives their revenues. And so compute drives revenues. And I think they all understand that. I think people are increasingly starting to understand that as well. And then lastly, the benefits that AI produces for the world ultimately has to generate revenues. And we're seeing right in front, right being developed as we see – as we stand here, agentic AI has turned an inflection point, and it literally happened in the last couple of two, three months. Of course, inside the industry, we've been seeing it for a while, probably six months or so, but the world is now awaken to the agentic AI inflection. The agents are super 17 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2026 FactSet CallStreet, LLC NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Corrected Transcript Q4 2026 Earnings Call 25-Feb-2026 smart. They're solving real problems. Coding is obviously supported by agentic systems now. And all of our coders here at NVIDIA are using agentic systems, either Claude Code or OpenAI Codex enormously to – and oftentimes both and Cursor, oftentimes all three, depends on the use case. But they have agents and co-design partners, engineering partners to help them solve problems. And you could see their revenues skyrocketing. These companies, in the case of Anthropic, I think their revenues 10xed in a year. And they are severely capacity constrained because demand is just incredible. And the token demand is incredible. The token generation rate is growing exponentially. And the same thing with, of course, OpenAI, their demand is incredible. And so the more compute that they can stand online, bring online, the faster their revenues will grow. And that goes back to the comment that I was saying that inference is revenues, that compute equals revenues","metadata":{"chunk_id":"b88e083a8550","file_name":"nvidia4.txt","file_path":"./transcripts\\nvidia4.txt","company":"NVDA","fy":"unknown","quarter":"unknown","date":"unknown","title":null,"section":"Operator","start_word_idx":8960,"end_word_idx":9360}}

And that goes back to the comment that I was saying that inference is revenues, that compute equals revenues now in this new world. And in a lot of ways, that's the reason why we say it's a new industrial revolution. There are new factories, new infrastructure being built and this new way of doing computing is not going to go back. And so to the extent that we believe that producing tokens is going to be the future of computing, which I believe, and I think largely the industry believes, then we're going to be building out this capacity from this point forward and continue to expand from here. Now the thing that is – the wave that we're seeing now is the agentic AI inflection and the next inflection beyond that is physical AI, where we take AI and these agentic systems into the physical applications such as manufacturing, such as robotics. And so that's a giant opportunity ahead.
